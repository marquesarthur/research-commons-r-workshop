Efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy on mental health and social function in patients with multiple sclerosis: A meta-Analysis.	"Objective To systematically review the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for improving mental health and social functions in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods We searched PubMed, EMbase, The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2016), CBM and CNKI from inception to May 2016, to collect randomized controlled trials (RCT) about CBT on mental health and social function in patients with MS. Two reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Then meta-analysis was performed by using RevMan 5.3 software. Results A total of 11 RCTs involving 1 102 patients were included. The results of meta-analysis showed that, the HADS scores (depression: MD= -1.28, 95%CI -2.07 to -0.48, P=0.002; anxiety: MD= -1.52, 95%CI -2.99 to -0.06,P=0.04), BDI scores (MD= -9.11, 95%CI -15.82 to -2.40,P=0.008), HRDS scores (MD= -7.23, 95%CI -13.65 to -0.82, P=0.03), Chalder scores (MD= -4.88, 95%CI -6.61 to -3.16, P<0.000 01), MFIS scores (MD= -2.98, 95%CI -4.52 to -1.44, P=0.000 2) and GHQ-12 scores (MD= -3.61, 95%CI -5.20 to -2.02, P<0.000 01) in the CBT group were lower than that in the control group. No significant difference was found in WSAS scores (MD= -1.98, 95%CI -4.88 to 0.93, P=0.18) between two groups. Conclusion CBT may be effective for improving the negative mental experience, fatigue and quality of life in MS. No evidence to support CBT has benefits in social functions. Due to the limited quantity and quality of the included studies, the above conclusion needs to be verified by more high quality studies."
Efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for childhood anxiety and depression	"A review of meta-analyses of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for childhood anxiety and depression was conducted. A total of 36 meta-analyses were identified that met inclusion criteria for this review. In most cases, medium-to-large effect sizes for treatment reduction were observed when CBT was compared to non-active control conditions. Small-to-medium effects were observed when CBT was compared to active control treatments. The available meta-analyses generally did not examine, or data were not sufficient to evaluate, potential moderators of outcome, differential effects for parental involvement, or changes in quality of life or functional outcomes associated with treatment. Accordingly, while CBT should be broadly considered an effective treatment approach for childhood anxiety and depression, additional research is warranted in order to establish guidelines for service delivery for complicating factors in client presentation.

Efficacy of Patient Navigation in Cancer Treatment: A Systematic Review	"Introduction: Patient navigation (PN) assists patients with financial, social, and health-related barriers to care by providing a personal escort to alleviate obstacles to achieve timely treatment. Herein we analyze the underexamined literature assessing PN efficacy for cancer patients undergoing treatment. Method: This review was conducted for all English language-published, peer-reviewed medical articles on PN for cancer from 1946 to 2014. Electronic databases included PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Review. Results: This systematic review yielded 15 relevant articles. Patients underwent breast, gynecologic, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancer treatment. Of the participating patients, 26% were Hispanic (SD ¬± 18), 28% black (SD ¬± 17), 54% white (SD ¬± 23), 3% Asian (SD ¬± 2), and 12% Other (SD ¬± 17). Two articles had 100% Native American participation. Many patients were non-English speakers (47% Spanish) and uninsured (33%). The most common barriers to care were finances, insurance, and lack of coordination of care. Navigators were mostly culturally competent bilingual nurses. When averaged, the mean days from diagnosis to treatment was 34 ¬± 14 days with PN compared with 55 ¬± 40 days for the control groups (P = .22). Two articles discussed palliative care. Conclusion: Many patients benefiting from PN were from a minority racial/ethnic group and non-English speaking. The most common barriers to care were finances and insurance. Most navigators were nurses. Patients receiving navigation-initiated treatment sooner than their non-navigated counterparts. PN's role in palliative care warrants further study."
Efficacy of person-centred care as an intervention in controlled trials - a systematic review	"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To identify person-centred care as an intervention in controlled trials, where patients had been involved as a partner, and to describe the outcomes of these studies. BACKGROUND: The notion of person-centred care asserts that patients are persons and partners in care and should not be reduced to their disease alone. DESIGN: A systematic literature review. METHOD: Searches were undertaken in the databases PUBMED and CINAHL. The inclusion criteria were that person-centred care as an intervention was described as a partnership between the caregiver and the patient, and that the studies were randomised controlled trials or quasi-experimental designs. The studies were analysed based on methodology, context and type of intervention, outcomes and effects of the interventions. Eleven trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: The studies were carried out in a variety of contexts with diverse outcomes. Person-centred care as an intervention was shown to be successful in eight of the studies. The internal and external validity in the studies were generally good. However, as regards the precision of the studies there was a wide variation. CONCLUSIONS: The value and efficacy of person-centred care as an intervention have only been studied to a limited extent. Methodological problems in trial design and execution could account for the general lack of research on person-centred care. Evidence that person-centred care is effective is insufficient, more stringent studies are needed. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The results suggest that person-centred care may lead to significant improvements, but the implementation and relevant effects needs to be assessed in more studies.

Efficacy of respiratory muscle training on pulmonary function of spinal cord injury patients: A meta-analysis.	"Objective To systematically review respiratory muscle training (RMT) on respiratory functions of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). Methods PubMed, EMbase and The Cochrane Library were electronically searched to collect the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about RMT on pulmonary functions in patients with SCI from inception to April, 2017. Two reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies, then, meta-analysis was performed by using RevMan 5.3 software. Results A total of 11 RCTs involving 263 patients were included. The results of meta-analysis showed that, compared with conventional rehabilitation group, RMT effectively improved vital capacity (MD=0.41, 95%CI 0.12 to 0.69, P=0.005), inspiratory capacity (MD=0.35, 95%CI 0.05 to 0.65, P=0.02), maximal inspiratory pressure (MD=7.75, 95%CI 0.11 to 15.39, P=0.05) and maximal voluntary ventilation (MD=17.52, 95%CI 8.11 to 26.93, P=0.000 3). There were significant differences between two groups. Conclusion Current evidence shows that RMT can effectively improve the respiratory function of Due patients with SCI. to limited quality and quantity of the included studies, more high quality studies are needed to verify above conclusion."
Efficacy of self-management programs in managing side effects of breast cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials.	"Background: Self-management programs are interventions that support patient empowerment of independent health behaviors. As the number of individuals surviving cancer is increasing, these programs are becoming more popular in clinical settings. However, there is currently no systematic review that assesses the effectiveness of self-management programs, specifically for individuals with breast cancer. Purpose: To determine the efficacy of self-management programs in decreasing treatment-related side effects experienced by breast cancer survivors at any point after their cancer diagnosis. Methods: An electronic literature search was conducted within the CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Ovid EMBASE, and MEDLINE online databases. Randomized controlled trials that included women who had a primary diagnosis of breast cancer, who had partaken in a self-management program, and whose outcomes were compared with women not participating in such programs were included in this review. Two reviewers independently screened and selected studies to be included and assessed risk of bias. A GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment Development and Evaluation) analysis was performed. Standard mean difference (SMD) and standard deviations were used to present the results of a meta-analysis of key outcomes. Results: Nine trials were included in this review. Self-management interventions were found to significantly improve health-related quality of life, SMD (95% confidence interval CI]) = 0.49 (0.16-0.82), P =.004; coping ability, SMD (95% CI) = 0.19 (0.03-0.34), P =.02; and fatigue, SMD (95% CI) = -0.94 (-1.69 to -0.18), P =.01. Conclusions: Self-management programs were found to be effective in improving the health-related quality of life, coping abilities, and fatigue in individuals who have experienced treatment side effects of breast cancer. However, studies included in this review had poor methodological quality. Therefore, the results of this review should be viewed with caution."
"Efficacy of Tai Chi on pain, stiffness and function in patients with osteoarthritis: a meta-analysis."	"BACKGROUND: Whether Tai Chi benefits patients with osteoarthritis remains controversial. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of Tai Chi exercise for pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with osteoarthritis. METHODS: A computerized search of PubMed and Embase (up to Sept 2012) was performed to identify relevant studies. The outcome measures were pain, stiffness, and physical function. Two investigators identified eligible studies and extracted data independently. The quality of the included studies was assessed by the Jadad score. Standard mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and pooled using a random effects model. The change in outcomes from baseline was compared to the minimum clinically important difference. RESULTS: A total of seven randomized controlled trials involving 348 patients with osteoarthritis met the inclusion criteria. The mean Jadad score was 3.6. The pooled SMD was -0.45 (95% CI -0.70--0.20, P = 0.0005) for pain, -0.31 (95% CI -0.60--0.02, P = 0.04) for stiffness, and -0.61 (95% CI -0.85--0.37, P<0.00001) for physical function. A change of 32.2-36.4% in the outcomes was greater than the minimum clinically important difference. CONCLUSIONS: Twelve-week Tai Chi is beneficial for improving arthritic symptoms and physical function in patients with osteoarthritis and should be included in rehabilitation programs. However, the evidence may be limited by potential biases; thus, larger scale randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the current findings and investigate the long-term effects of Tai Chi."
Efficacy of tai chi on patients with heart failure: A systematic review.	"Objective To systematically review the efficacy of Tai Chi on patients with heart failure. Methods Databases including CNKI, VIP, WanFang Data, Web of Science, PubMed, EMbase and The Cochrane Library (Issue 8, 2016) were searched from inception to August, 2016 to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Tai Chi for heart failure patients. Two reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Then meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Results A total of 10 RCTs involving 689 patients were included. The results of meta-analysis showed that, compared with the control group, the heart failure patients in Tai Chi group had better score of minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire (MLHFQ) (MD=-9.37, 95%CI -13.09 to -5.65, P2max) (MD=0.29, 95%CI -1.223 to 1.81, P=0.71), systolic pressure (SBP) (MD=-2.81, 95%CI -8.52 to 2.90, P=0.33) and diastolic pressure (DBP) (MD=0.37, 95%CI -3.73 to 4.48, P=0.86), there were no significant differences between both groups. Conclusion The current evidence shows that Tai Chi is feasible for patients with heart failure as it has positive effects on life quality, physiological functions. Due to the limited quality and quantity of included studies, the above conclusion should be validated by more high quality studies."
Efficacy of telephone-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia: A meta-analysis.	"Objectives To systematically review the efficacy of telephone-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia. Methods Databases including PubMed, EMbase, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library (Issue 7, 2015), CBM and CNKI were searched from inception to July 2015, to collect randomized controlled trials (RCT) about telephone-delivered CBT for insomnia. Two reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Then, RevMan 5.2 software was used to performing meta-analysis. Results Five RCTs involving 322 patients were included. The results of meta-analysis showed that: Compared with the waiting group, the sleep onset latency was shorter (MD= -30.31, 95% CI -40.41 to -20.22, P<0.000 01), the waking after sleep onset was shorter (MD= -15.59, 95% CI -24.09 to -7.09, P=0.000 3) and the sleep efficiency was higher (MD=11.02, 95% CI 7.87 to 14.18, P<0.000 01) in the telephone-delivered CBT group, but there was no significant difference between the two groups in total sleep time (MD=13.45, 95% CI -37.01 to 63.92, P=0.60). Conclusion Current evidence shows, telephonedelivered CBT is effective for insomnia. Due to limited quantity and quality of the included studies, the above conclusion needs to be verified by more large-scale, high quality RCTs."
Efficacy of theory-based interventions for young people with type 1 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis	"PURPOSE: Theory-based behaviour change interventions have been recommended to improve outcomes for young people with type 1 diabetes. However, theory has exclusively been considered in a simplistic all-or-none fashion. We therefore (1) examined the nature and extent of explicit theory use in published interventions involving young people with type 1 diabetes and (2) the relationship between how theory is used and intervention outcomes. METHODS: We conducted systematic searches for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1999 and 2012. We used a detailed structured framework to code how theory was used and meta-analytic techniques to examine the relationships between theory use and intervention efficacy. RESULTS: We identified 34 articles comprising 27 RCTs. Thirty per cent (k = 8) did not use theory in any of the ways assessed. Where present, the most common use of theory was providing evidence that a targeted theoretical construct predicted behaviour (k = 15; 56%). Trials that used theory to some extent had marginally larger pooled effect sizes for both medical and psychological outcomes than those that did not. However, in meta-regression models, use of theory did not significantly predict intervention outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Theory is under-utilized in intervention development for young people with type 1 diabetes. When employed, theory appears to be advantageous, but not necessarily predictive of intervention success. We argue that greater emphasis is needed on choosing appropriate theory, which should then become central to the process of intervention development. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Interventions for young people with type 1 diabetes that explicitly cite a theoretical basis may be more effective than those that do not. Recommendations have been made for theory to be central to the intervention development process in this area. What does this study add? Theory use in recent interventions for young people with type 1 diabetes is extremely limited. Larger positive medical and psychological outcomes are observed in interventions making some use of theory. Greater use of theory does not necessarily guarantee intervention success.

eHealth for Patient Engagement: A Systematic Review	"eHealth interventions are recognized to have a tremendous potential to promote patient engagement. To date, the majority of studies examine the efficacy of eHealth in enhancing clinical outcomes without focusing on patient engagement in its specificity. This paper aimed at reviewing findings from the literature about the use of eHealth in engaging patients in their own care process. We undertook a comprehensive literature search within the peer-reviewed international literature. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. eHealth interventions reviewed were mainly devoted to foster only partial dimensions of patient engagement (i.e., alternatively cognitive, emotional or behavioral domains related to healthcare management), thus failing to consider the complexity of such an experience. This also led to a great heterogeneity of technologies, assessed variables and achieved outcomes. This systematic review underlines the need for a more holistic view of patient needs to actually engage them in eHealth interventions and obtaining positive outcomes. In this sense, patient engagement constitute a new frontiers for healthcare models where eHealth could maximize its potentialities."
eHealth literacy interventions for older adults: a systematic review of the literature	"BACKGROUND: eHealth resources offer new opportunities for older adults to access health information online, connect with others with shared health interests, and manage their health. However, older adults often lack sufficient eHealth literacy to maximize their benefit from these resources. OBJECTIVE: This review evaluates the research design, methods, and findings of eHealth literacy interventions for older adults. METHODS: A systematic review of peer-reviewed research articles from 28 databases in 9 fields was carried out in January 2013. Four rounds of screening of articles in these databases resulted in a final sample of 23 articles. RESULTS: Findings indicated a significant gap in the literature for eHealth literacy interventions evaluating health outcomes as the outcome of interest, a lack of theory-based interventions, and few studies applied high-quality research design. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasize the need for researchers to develop and assess theory-based interventions applying high-quality research design in eHealth literacy interventions targeting the older population."
EHealth Technologies in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review	"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Electronic-health technologies (eHealth) such as Web-based interventions, virtual clinics, smart-phone applications, and telemedicine are being used to manage patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to: (1) Evaluate the impact of eHealth technologies on conventional clinical indices and patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) in IBD; (2) assess the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of using eHealth technologies to facilitate the self-management of individuals with IBD, and; (3) provide recommendations for their design and optimal use for patient care. METHODS: Relevant publications were identified via a literature search, and 17 publications were selected based on predefined quality parameters. RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials and nine observational studies utilizing eHealth technologies in IBD were identified. Compared with standard outpatient-led care, eHealth technologies have led to improvements in: Relapse duration (n = 1) 18 days vs 77 days, p < 0.001]; disease activity (n = 2); short-term medication adherence (n = 3); quality of life (n = 4); IBD knowledge (n = 2); healthcare costs (n = 4); the number of acute visits to the outpatient clinic due to IBD symptoms (n = 1), and; facilitating the remote management of up to 20% of an IBD cohort (n = 2). Methodological shortcomings of eHealth studies include heterogeneity of outcome measures, lack of clinician/patient input, lack of validation against conventional clinical indices and PROs, and limited cost-benefit analyses. CONCLUSIONS: EHealth technologies have the potential for promoting self-management and reducing the impact of the growing burden of IBD on health care resource utilization. A theoretical framework should be applied to the development, implementation, and evaluation of eHealth interventions. Copyright ¬© 2016 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

Electronic assistive technology for community-dwelling solo-living older adults: A systematic review.	"The proportion of older adults who live alone in single households is growing continuously. In the care of these solo-living older adults, electronic assistive technology (EAT) can play an important role. The objective of this review is to investigate the effects of EAT on the wellbeing of community-dwelling older adults living alone in single households. A systematic review of English articles was conducted based on PMC, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane database. Additional studies were identified from the references. In total, 16 studies were identified, six of them with follow-up. There is evidence that EAT can improve the physical and mental wellbeing of older adults. There was little evidence that EAT can improve social wellbeing. We conclude that more personalized designs and interventions, and more user engagement could be embedded in the design of EAT for solo-living community-dwelling older adults and that more evidence is needed regarding the effects of those interventions."
Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation.	"Background Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are electronic devices that heat a liquid into an aerosol for inhalation. The liquid usually comprises propylene glycol and glycerol, with or without nicotine and flavours, and stored in disposable or refillable cartridges or a reservoir. Since ECs appeared on the market in 2006 there has been a steady growth in sales. Smokers report using ECs to reduce risks of smoking, but some healthcare organizations, tobacco control advocacy groups and policy makers have been reluctant to encourage smokers to switch to ECs, citing lack of evidence of efficacy and safety. Smokers, healthcare providers and regulators are interested to know if these devices can help smokers quit and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This review is an update of a review first published in 2014. Objectives To evaluate the safety and effect of using ECs to help people who smoke achieve long-term smoking abstinence. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO for relevant records from 2004 to January 2016, together with reference checking and contact with study authors. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which current smokers (motivated or unmotivated to quit) were randomized to EC or a control condition, and which measured abstinence rates at six months or longer. As the field of EC research is new, we also included cohort follow-up studies with at least six months follow-up. We included randomized cross-over trials, RCTs and cohort follow-up studies that included at least one week of EC use for assessment of adverse events (AEs). Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Our main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up, and we used the most rigorous definition available (continuous, biochemically validated, longest follow-up). We used a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel model to calculate the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for each study, and where appropriate we pooled data from these studies in meta-analyses. Main results Our searches identified over 1700 records, from which we include 24 completed studies (three RCTs, two of which were eligible for our cessation meta-analysis, and 21 cohort studies). Eleven of these studies are new for this version of the review. We identified 27 ongoing studies. Two RCTs compared EC with placebo (non-nicotine) EC, with a combined sample size of 662 participants. One trial included minimal telephone support and one recruited smokers not intending to quit, and both used early EC models with low nicotine content and poor battery life. We judged the RCTs to be at low risk of bias, but under the GRADE system we rated the overall quality of the evidence for our outcomes as 'low' or 'very low', because of imprecision due to the small number of trials. A 'low' grade means that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. A 'very low' grade means we are very uncertain about the estimate. Participants using an EC were more likely to have abstained from smoking for at least six months compared with participants using placebo EC (RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.05 to 4.96; placebo 4% versus EC 9%; 2 studies; 662 participants. GRADE: low). The one study that compared EC to nicotine patch found no significant difference in six-month abstinence rates, but the confidence intervals do not rule out a clinically important difference (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.34; 584 participants. GRADE: very low). Authors' conclusions There is evidence from two trials that ECs help smokers to stop smoking in the long term compared with placebo ECs. However, the small number of trials, low event rates and wide confidence intervals around the estimates mean that our confidence in the result is rated 'low' by GRADE standards. The lack of difference between the effect of ECs compared with nicotine patches found in one trial is uncertain for similar reasons. None of the included studies (short- to mid-term, up to two years) detected serious adverse events considered possibly related to EC use. The most commonly reported adverse effects were irritation of the mouth and throat. The long-term safety of ECs is unknown. In this update, we found a further 15 ongoing RCTs which appear eligible for this review."
ELECTRONIC DEVICES FOR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT SCREENING: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW	"OBJECTIVES: The reduction in cognitive decline depends on timely diagnosis. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the current available information and communication technologies-based instruments for cognitive decline early screening and detection in terms of usability, validity, and reliability. METHODS: Electronic searches identified 1,785 articles of which thirty-four met the inclusion criteria and were grouped according to their main purpose into test batteries, measures of isolated tasks, behavioral measures, and diagnostic tools. RESULTS: Thirty one instruments were analyzed. Fifty-two percent were personal computer based, 26 percent tablet, 13 percent laptop, and 1 was mobile phone based. The most common input method was touchscreen (48 percent). The instruments were validated with a total of 4,307 participants: 2,146 were healthy older adults (M = 73.59; SD = 5.12), 1,104 had dementia (M = 74.65; SD = 3.98) and 1,057 mild cognitive impairment (M = 74.84; SD = 4.46). Only 6 percent were administered at home, 19 percent reported outcomes about usability, and 22 percent about understandability. The methodological quality of the studies was good, the weakest methodological area being usability. Most of the instruments obtained acceptable values of specificity and sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to create home delivered instruments and to include usability studies in their design. Involvement of people with cognitive decline in all phases of the development process is of great importance to obtain valuable and user-friendly products. It would be advisable for researchers to make an effort to provide cutoff points for their instruments."
Electronic Systems for Patients to Report and Manage Side Effects of Cancer Treatment: Systematic Review	"BACKGROUND: There has been a dramatic increase in the development of electronic systems to support cancer patients to report and manage side effects of treatment from home. Systems vary in the features they offer to patients, which may affect how patients engage with them and how they improve patient-centered outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to (1) describe the features and functions of existing electronic symptom reporting systems (eg, symptom monitoring, tailored self-management advice), and (2) explore which features may be associated with patient engagement and patient-centered outcomes. METHODS: The review was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) and followed guidelines from the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (University of York, United Kingdom). Primary searches were undertaken of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Health Technology Assessment databases. Secondary searches were undertaken by screening reference lists and citations. Two researchers applied broad inclusion criteria to identify and select relevant records. Data were extracted and summarized using Microsoft Excel. In order to meet the aims, the study selection, data extraction, and data synthesis comprised two stages: (1) identifying and characterizing available systems and (2) summarizing data on patient engagement and patient-centered outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 77 publications relating to 41 distinct systems. In Stage 1, all publications were included (N=77). The features identified that supported clinicians and care were facility for health professionals to remotely access and monitor patient-reported data (24/41, 58%) and function to send alerts to health professionals for severe symptoms (17/41, 41%). Features that supported patients were facility for patients to monitor/review their symptom reports over time (eg, graphs) (19/41, 46%), general patient information about cancer treatment and side effects (17/41, 41%), tailored automated patient advice on symptom management (12/41, 29%), feature for patients to communicate with the health care team (6/41, 15%), and a forum for patients to communicate with one another (4/41, 10%). In Stage 2, only publications that included some data on patient engagement or patient-centered outcomes were included (N=29). A lack of consistency between studies in how engagement was defined, measured, or reported, and a wide range of methods chosen to evaluate systems meant that it was not possible to compare across studies or make conclusions on relationships with system features. CONCLUSIONS: Electronic systems have the potential to help patients manage side effects of cancer treatment, with some evidence to suggest a positive effect on patient-centered outcomes. However, comparison across studies is difficult due to the wide range of assessment tools used. There is a need to develop guidelines for assessing and reporting engagement with systems, and a set of core outcomes for evaluation. We hope that this review will contribute to the field by introducing a taxonomy for characterizing system features.

"Electronic, mobile and telehealth tools for vulnerable patients with chronic disease: a systematic review and realist synthesis."	"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to assess the benefit of using electronic, mobile and telehealth tools for vulnerable patients with chronic disease and explore the mechanisms by which these impact patient self-efficacy and self-management. DESIGN: We searched MEDLINE, all evidence-based medicine, CINAHL, Embase and PsychINFO covering the period 2009 to 2018 for electronic, mobile or telehealth interventions. Quality was assessed according to rigour and relevance. Those studies providing a richer description ('thick') were synthesised using a realist matrix. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Studies of any design conducted in community-based primary care involving adults with one or more diagnosed chronic health condition and vulnerability due to demographic, geographic, economic and/or cultural characteristics. RESULTS: Eighteen trials were identified targeting a range of chronic conditions and vulnerabilities. The data provided limited insight into the mechanisms underpinning these interventions, most of which sought to persuade vulnerable patients into believing they could self-manage their conditions through improved symptom monitoring, education and support and goal setting. Patients were relatively passive in the interaction, and the level of patient response attributed to their intrinsic level of motivation. Health literacy, which may be confounded with motivation, was only measured in one study, and eHealth literacy was not assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Research incorporating these tools with vulnerable groups is not comprehensive. Apart from intrinsic motivation, health literacy may also influence the reaction of vulnerable groups to technology. Social persuasion was the main way interventions sought to achieve better self-management. Efforts to engage patients by healthcare providers were lower than expected. Use of social networks or other eHealth mechanisms to link patients and provide opportunities for vicarious experience could be further explored in relation to vulnerable groups. Future research could also assess health and eHealth literacy and differentiate the specific needs for vulnerable groups when implementing health technologies.

Electrotherapy for neck pain.	"Background Neck pain is common, disabling and costly. The effectiveness of electrotherapy as a physiotherapeutic option remains unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005 and previously updated in 2009. Objectives This systematic review assessed the short, intermediate and long-term effects of electrotherapy on pain, function, disability, patient satisfaction, global perceived effect, and quality of life in adults with neck pain with and without radiculopathy or cervicogenic headache. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, MANTIS, CINAHL, and ICL, without language restrictions, from their beginning to August 2012; handsearched relevant conference proceedings; and consulted content experts. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), in any language, investigating the effects of electrotherapy used primarily as unimodal treatment for neck pain. Quasi-RCTs and controlled clinical trials were excluded. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We were unable to statistically pool any of the results, but we assessed the quality of the evidence using an adapted GRADE approach. Main results Twenty small trials (1239 people with neck pain) containing 38 comparisons were included. Analysis was limited by trials of varied quality, heterogeneous treatment subtypes and conflicting results. The main findings for reduction of neck pain by treatment with electrotherapeutic modalities were as follows. Authors' conclusions We cannot make any definite statements on the efficacy and clinical usefulness of electrotherapy modalities for neck pain. Since the evidence is of low or very low quality, we are uncertain about the estimate of the effect. Further research is very likely to change both the estimate of effect and our confidence in the results. Current evidence for PEMF, rMS, and TENS shows that these modalities might be more effective than placebo. When compared to other interventions the quality of evidence was very low thus preventing further recommendations."
Elements of Family-Centered Care in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit: An Integrative Review	"This article reports results from a systematic search and thematic analysis of qualitative literature to identify key issues related to family-centered care, behaviors, and communication skills that support the parental role and improve patient and family outcomes in the pediatric intensive care unit. Five themes were identified: (1) sharing information, (2) hearing parental voices, (3) making decisions for or with parents, (4) negotiating roles, and (5) individualizing communication. These themes highlight several gaps between how parents want to be involved and how they perceive clinicians' engagementwith themin the care of their child. Parental preferences for involvement differ in the domains of information sharing, decision making, and power sharing across a spectrum of parental roles from parents as care provider to care recipient. The pediatric intensive care unit setting may place clinicians in a double bind trying to both engage families and protect them from distress. Asking families of critically ill children about their preferences for participation across these domains may improve clinician-family relationships."
Elements of Trust in Digital Health Systems: Scoping Review	"BACKGROUND: Information and communication technologies have long become prominent components of health systems. Rapid advances in digital technologies and data science over the last few years are predicted to have a vast impact on health care services, configuring a paradigm shift into what is now commonly referred to as digital health. Forecasted to curb rising health costs as well as to improve health system efficiency and safety, digital health success heavily relies on trust from professional end users, administrators, and patients. Yet, what counts as the building blocks of trust in digital health systems has so far remained underexplored. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze what relevant stakeholders consider as enablers and impediments of trust in digital health. METHODS: We performed a scoping review to map out trust in digital health. To identify relevant digital health studies, we searched 5 electronic databases. Using keywords and Medical Subject Headings, we targeted all relevant studies and set no boundaries for publication year to allow a broad range of studies to be identified. The studies were screened by 2 reviewers after which a predefined data extraction strategy was employed and relevant themes documented. RESULTS: Overall, 278 qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods, and intervention studies in English, published between 1998 and 2017 and conducted in 40 countries were included in this review. Patients and health care professionals were the two most prominent stakeholders of trust in digital health; a third-health administrators-was substantially less prominent. Our analysis identified cross-cutting personal, institutional, and technological elements of trust that broadly cluster into 16 enablers (altruism, fair data access, ease of use, self-efficacy, sociodemographic factors, recommendation by other users, usefulness, customizable design features, interoperability, privacy, initial face-to-face contact, guidelines for standardized use, stakeholder engagement, improved communication, decreased workloads, and service provider reputation) and 10 impediments (excessive costs, limited accessibility, sociodemographic factors, fear of data exploitation, insufficient training, defective technology, poor information quality, inadequate publicity, time-consuming, and service provider reputation) to trust in digital health. CONCLUSIONS: Trust in digital health technologies and services depends on the interplay of a complex set of enablers and impediments. This study is a contribution to ongoing efforts to understand what determines trust in digital health according to different stakeholders. Therefore, it offers valuable points of reference for the implementation of innovative digital health services. Building on insights from this study, actionable metrics can be developed to assess the trustworthiness of digital technologies in health care.

Eliciting the Impact of Digital Consulting for Young People Living With Long-Term Conditions (LYNC Study): Cognitive Interviews to Assess the Face and Content Validity of Two Patient-Reported Outcome Measures.	"BACKGROUND: Digital consulting, using email, text, and Skype, is increasingly offered to young people accessing specialist care for long-term conditions. No patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have been evaluated for assessing outcomes of digital consulting. Systematic and scoping reviews, alongside patient involvement, revealed 2 candidate PROMs for this purpose: the patient activation measure (PAM) and the physician's humanistic behaviors questionnaire (PHBQ). PAM measures knowledge, beliefs, and skills that enable people to manage their long-term conditions. PHBQ assesses the presence of behaviors that are important to patients in their physician-patient interactions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the face and content validity of PAM and PHBQ to explore whether they elicit important outcomes of digital consulting and whether the PROMs can isolate the digital consultation component of care. METHODS: Participants were drawn from 5 clinics providing specialist National Health Service care to 16- to 24-year-olds with long-term health conditions participating in the wider LYNC (Long-Term Conditions, Young People, Networked Communications) study. Overall, 14 people undertook a cognitive interview in this substudy. Of these, 7 participants were young people with either inflammatory bowel disease, cystic fibrosis, or cancer. The remaining 7 participants were clinicians who were convenience sampled. These included a clinical psychologist, 2 nurses, 3 consultant physicians, and a community youth worker practicing in cancer, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and liver disease. Cognitive interviews were transcribed and analyzed, and a spreadsheet recorded the participants' PROM item appraisals. Illustrative quotes were extracted verbatim from the interviews for all participants. RESULTS: Young people found 11 of the PAM 13 items and 7 of the additional 8 PAM 22 items to be relevant to digital consulting. They were only able to provide spontaneous examples of digital consulting for 50% (11/22) of the items. Of the 7 clinicians, 4 appraised all PAM 13 items and 20 of the PAM 22 items to be relevant to evaluating digital consulting and articulated operationalization of the items with reference to their own digital consulting practice with greater ease than the young people. Appraising the PHBQ, in 14 of the 25 items, two-thirds of the young people's appraisals offered digital consulting examples with ease, suggesting that young people can detect and discern humanistic clinician behaviors via digital as well as face-to-face communication channels. Moreover, 17 of the 25 items were appraised as relevant by the young people. This finding was mirrored in the clinician appraisals. Both young people and the clinicians found the research task complex. Young participants required considerably more researcher prompting to elicit examples related to digital consulting rather than their face-to-face care. CONCLUSIONS: PAM and PHBQ have satisfactory face and content validity for evaluating digital consulting to warrant proceeding to psychometric evaluation. Completion instructions require revision to differentiate between digital and face-to-face consultations.

Email for clinical communication between patients/caregivers and healthcare professionals.	"Background Email is a popular and commonly-used method of communication but its use in health care is not routine Where email communication has been demonstrated in health care this has included its use for communication between patients/caregivers and healthcare professionals for clinical purposes but the effects of using email in this way is not known.This review addresses the use of email for two-way clinical communication between patients/caregivers and healthcare professionals. Objectives To assess the effects of healthcare professionals and patients using email to communicate with each other on patient outcomes health service performance service efficiency and acceptability. Search methods We searched: the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group Specialised Register Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL The Cochrane Library, Issue 1 2010) MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1950 to January 2010) EMBASE (OvidSP) (1980 to January 2010) PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1967 to January 2010) CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (1982 to February 2010) and ERIC (CSA) (1965 to January 2010) We searched grey literature: theses/dissertation repositories trials registers and Google Scholar (searched July 2010) We used additional search methods: examining reference lists contacting authors. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials quasi-randomised trials controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series studies examining interventions using email to allow patients to communicate clinical concerns to a healthcare professional and receive a reply and taking the form of 1) unsecured email 2) secure email or 3) web messaging All healthcare professionals patients and caregivers in all settings were considered. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data We contacted study authors for additional information We assessed risk of bias according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions For continuous measures we report effect sizes as mean differences (MD) For dichotomous outcome measures we report effect sizes as odds ratios and rate ratios Where it was not possible to calculate an effect estimate we report mean values for both intervention and control groups and the total number of participants in each group Where data are available only as median values it is presented as such It was not possible to carry out any meta-analysis of the data. Main results We included nine trials enrolling 1733 patients; all trials were judged to be at risk of bias Seven were randomised controlled trials; two were cluster-randomised controlled designs Eight examined email as compared to standard methods of communication One compared email with telephone for the delivery of counselling When email was compared to standard methods for the majority of patient/caregiver outcomes it was not possible to adequately assess whether email had any effect For health service use outcomes it was not possible to adequately assess whether email has any effect on resource use but some results indicated that an email intervention leads to an increased number of emails and telephone calls being received by healthcare professionals Three studies reported some type of adverse event but it was not clear if the adverse event had any impact on the health of the patient or the quality of health care When email counselling was compared to telephone counselling only patient outcomes were measured and for the majority of measures there was no difference between groups Where there were differences these showed that telephone counselling leads to greater change in lifestyle modification factors than email counselling There was one outcome relating to harm which showed no difference between the email and the telephone counselling groups There were no primary outcomes relating to healthcare professionals for either comparison. Authors' conclusions The evidence base was found to be limited with variable results and missing data and therefore it was not possible to adequately assess the effect of email for clinical communication between patients/caregivers and healthcare professionals Recommendations for clinical practice could not be made Future research should ideally address the issue of missing data and methodological concerns by adhering to published reporting standards The rapidly changing nature of technology should be taken into account when designing and conducting future studies and barriers to trial development and implementation should also be tackled Potential outcomes of interest for future research include cost-effectiveness and health service resource use."
Email for communicating results of diagnostic medical investigations to patients.	"Background As medical care becomes more complex and the ability to test for conditions grows, pressure on healthcare providers to convey increasing volumes of test results to patients is driving investigation of alternative technological solutions for their delivery. This review addresses the use of email for communicating results of diagnostic medical investigations to patients. Objectives To assess the effects of using email for communicating results of diagnostic medical investigations to patients, compared to SMS/ text messaging, telephone communication or usual care, on outcomes, including harms, for health professionals, patients and caregivers, and health services. Search methods We searched: the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1 2010), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1950 to January 2010), EMBASE (OvidSP) (1980 to January 2010), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1967 to January 2010), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (1982 to February 2010), and ERIC (CSA) (1965 to January 2010). We searched grey literature: theses/dissertation repositories, trials registers and Google Scholar (searched July 2010). We used additional search methods: examining reference lists and contacting authors. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series studies of interventions using email for communicating results of any diagnostic medical investigations to patients, and taking the form of 1) unsecured email 2) secure email or 3) web messaging. All healthcare professionals, patients and caregivers in all settings were considered. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts of retrieved citations. No studies were identified for inclusion. Consequently, no data collection or analysis was possible. Main results No studies met the inclusion criteria, therefore there are no results to report on the use of email for communicating results of diagnostic medical investigations to patients. Authors' conclusions In the absence of included studies, we can draw no conclusions on the effects of using email for communicating results of diagnostic medical investigations to patients, and thus no recommendations for practice can be stipulated. Further well-designed research should be conducted to inform practice and policy for communicating patient results via email, as this is a developing area."
Email for the coordination of healthcare appointments and attendance reminders.	"Background Email is a popular and commonly-used method of communication, but its use in health care is not routine. Where email communication has been utilised in health care, its purposes have included the coordination of healthcare appointments and attendance reminders, but the effects of using email in this way are not known. This review considers the use of email for the coordination of healthcare appointments and reminders for attendance; particularly scheduling, rescheduling and cancelling healthcare appointments, and providing prompts/reminders for attendance at appointments. Objectives To assess the effects of using email for the coordination of healthcare appointments and attendance reminders, compared to other forms of coordinating appointments and reminders, on outcomes for health professionals, patients and carers, and health services, including harms. Search methods We searched: the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1 2010), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1950 to January 2010), EMBASE (OvidSP) (1980 to January 2010), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1967 to January 2010), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (1982 to February 2010),and ERIC (CSA) (1965 to January 2010). We searched grey literature: theses/dissertation repositories, trials registers and Google Scholar (searched July 2010). We used additional search methods: examining reference lists and contacting authors. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series studies of interventions that use email for scheduling health appointments, for reminders for a scheduled health appointment or for ongoing coordination of health appointments and that took the form of 1) unsecured email 2) secure email or 3) web messaging. All healthcare professionals, patients and caregivers in all settings were considered. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts of retrieved citations. No studies were identified for inclusion. Consequently, no data collection or analysis was possible. Main results No studies met the inclusion criteria, therefore there are no results to report on the use of email for the coordination of healthcare appointments and attendance reminders. Authors' conclusions No conclusions on the effects of using email for the coordination of healthcare appointments and attendance reminders could be made and thus no recommendations for practice can be stipulated. Given the significant theoretical opportunities that email presents, there is a need for rigorous studies addressing the review question, but this may involve addressing barriers concerning trial development and implementation."
Emergency department data sharing to reduce alcohol-related violence: a systematic review of the feasibility and effectiveness of community-level interventions	"The present paper aims to review current evidence for the effectiveness and/or feasibility of using inter-agency data sharing of ED recorded assault information to direct interventions reducing alcohol-related or nightlife assaults, injury or violence. Potential data-sharing partners involve police, local council, liquor licensing regulators and venue management. A systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature was conducted. The initial search discovered 19506 articles. After removal of duplicates and articles not meeting review criteria, n=8 articles were included in quantitative and narrative synthesis. Seven of eight studies were conducted in UK EDs, with the remaining study presenting Australian data. All studies included in the review deemed data sharing a worthwhile pursuit. All studies attempting to measure intervention effectiveness reported substantial reductions of assaults and ED attendances post-intervention, with one reporting no change. Negative logistic feasibility concerns were minimal, with general consensus among authors being that data-sharing protocols and partnerships could be easily implemented into modern ED triage systems, with minimal cost, staff workload burden, impact to patient safety, service and anonymity, or risk of harm displacement to other licensed venues, or increase to length of patient stay. However, one study reported a potential harm displacement effect to streets surrounding intervention venues. In future, data-sharing systems should triangulate ED, police and ambulance data sources, and assess intervention effectiveness using randomised controlled trials that account for variations in venue capacity, fluctuations in ED attendance and population levels, seasonal variations in assault and injury, and control for concurrent interventions."
Emergency Department Patient Experience: A Systematic Review of the Literature.	"Introduction: Patient experience with emergency department (ED) care is an expanding area of focus, and recent literature has demonstrated strong correlation between patient experience and meeting several ED and hospital goals. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review of existing literature to identify specific factors most commonly identified as influencing ED patient experience. Methods: A literature search was performed, and articles were included if published in peer-reviewed journals, primarily focused on ED patient experience, employed observational or interventional methodology, and were available in English. After a structured screening process, 107 publications were included for data extraction. Result: Of the 107 included publications, 51 were published before 2011, 57% were conducted by American investigators, and 12% were published in nursing journals. The most commonly identified themes included staff-patient communication, ED wait times, and staff empathy and compassion. Conclusion: The most commonly identified drivers of ED patient experience include communication, wait times, and staff empathy; however, existing literature is limited. Additional investigation is necessary to further characterize ED patient experience themes and identify interventions that effectively improve these domains."
Employment Interventions in Health Settings: A Systematic Review and Synthesis	"PURPOSE: Employment is a key social determinant of health. People who are unemployed typically have worse health than those employed. Illness and disability can result in unemployment and be a barrier to regaining employment. We combined a systematic review and knowledge synthesis to identify both studies of employment interventions in health care settings and common characteristics of successful interventions. METHODS: We searched the peer-reviewed literature (1995-2017), and titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria by 2 independent reviewers. We extracted data on the study setting, participants, intervention, methods, and findings. We also conducted a narrative synthesis and iteratively developed a conceptual model to inform future primary care interventions. RESULTS: Of 6,729 unique citations, 88 articles met our criteria. Most articles (89%) focused on people with mental illness. The majority of articles (74%) tested interventions that succeeded in helping participants gain employment. We identified 5 key features of successful interventions: (1) a multidisciplinary team that communicates regularly and collaborates, (2) a comprehensive package of services, (3) one-on-one and tailored components, (4) a holistic view of health and social needs, and (5) prospective engagement with employers. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings can inform new interventions that focus on employment as a social determinant of health. Although hiring a dedicated employment specialist may not be feasible for most primary care organizations, pathways using existing resources with links to external agencies can be created. As precarious work becomes more common, helping patients engage in safe and productive employment could improve health, access to health care, and well-being.

Empowerment of Cancer Survivors Through Information Technology: An Integrative Review	"Background: Patient empowerment may be an effective approach to strengthen the role of cancer survivors and to reduce the burden on health care. However, it is not well conceptualized, notably in oncology. Furthermore, it is unclear to what extent information technology (IT) services can contribute to empowerment of cancer survivors.Objective: We aim to define the conceptual components of patient empowerment of chronic disease patients, especially cancer survivors, and to explore the contribution of existing and new IT services to promote empowerment.Methods: Electronic databases were searched to identify theoretical and empirical articles regarding empowerment. We extracted and synthesized conceptual components of patient empowerment (ie, attributes, antecedents, and consequences) according to the integrated review methodology. We identified recent IT services for cancer survivors by examining systematic reviews and a proposed inventory of new services, and we related their features and effects to the identified components of empowerment.Results: Based on 26 articles, we identified five main attributes of patient empowerment: (1) being autonomous and respected, (2) having knowledge, (3) having psychosocial and behavioral skills, (4) perceiving support from community, family, and friends, and (5) perceiving oneself to be useful. The latter two were specific for the cancer setting. Systematic reviews of IT services and our additional inventory helped us identify five main categories: (1) educational services, including electronic survivorship care plan services, (2) patient-to-patient services, (3) electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) services, (4) multicomponent services, and (5) portal services. Potential impact on empowerment included knowledge enhancement and, to a lesser extent, enhancing autonomy and skills. Newly developed services offer promising and exciting opportunities to empower cancer survivors, for instance, by providing tailored advice for supportive or follow-up care based on patients' input.Conclusions: We identified five main components of empowerment and showed that IT services may especially contribute to empowerment by providing knowledge. The components of empowerment could be used to develop IT services for cancer survivors. It is important to take into account patients' needs, follow up on these needs, and create a service that is attractive and easy to use."
Empowerment: healthcare professionals' and community members' contributions	"Healthcare disparities for minorities are well reported and related to individual, provider and system characteristics. This paper reports a meta-synthesis of ""empowerment with Hispanic and Latino people. This meta-synthesis utilized Noblit and Hare's meta-ethnographic method (1988) examining seven qualitative studies to discover strategies of empowerment by healthcare professionals for Hispanic/Latino people. Three themes were disclosed: strategies for empowerment, sharing power, and growth of the Hispanic/Latino culture in the United States. These themes expand existing conceptualizations of ways in which health care professionals and community members can work in a participatory research approach to improve healthcare outcomes as well as empowering the community."
Enablement in health care context: a concept analysis	"The enablement process is defined as a professional intervention aiming to recognize, support and emphasize the patient's capacity to have control over her or his health and life. The purpose of this article was to study the enablement concept through a concept analysis in the health care context to identify: (1) its attributes and (2) its antecedents and consequents. A concept analysis was performed according to the method of Rodgers. The literature was reviewed from 1980 to June 2008, using search strategies adapted to the databases Cinahl, Medline, Embase, PsycInfo and Social Works Abstract, and hand searching. All articles contributing to a deeper understanding of the concept were included. The analysis was carried out according to a thematic analysis procedure, as described by Miles & Huberman. The search identified 1305 citations. After in-depth assessment of 148 potentially eligible citations, 61 articles were included in the review. Five articles were added with hand searching. Sixty-seven per cent of these articles were related to nursing. The attributes of the enablement concept included: contribution to the therapeutic relationship; consideration of the person as a whole; facilitation of learning; valorization of the person's strengths; implication and support to decision making; and broadening of the possibilities. These attributes could be used as a basis for other studies on enablement. Conceptual and empirical work is still needed to better position this concept among others such as patient-centred care, shared decision making and patient's participation."
Enablers and inhibitors: A review of the situation regarding mHealth adoption in low- and middle-income countries.	"Objective: The objective of this review is to identify enabling and inhibiting factors for mHealth adoption in low resource settings, by giving emphasis on the stakeholders representing the caregiving side. Another objective of this study is to support implementation agencies (governmental and non-governmental) in designing scalable mHealth interventions. Methods: A PEO (Population, Exposure, Outcome) approach was used to formulate the review question. A pre-defined search strategy was implemented; Google Scholar, PubMed and gray literature were searched using alternate terms for ""mHealth"" ""adoption"" and ""developing countries"". CASP 7] tools were used to assess the quality of selected evidence. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria on search results and critical appraisal of the selected evidence, twelve studies were selected for the review. Results: Adoption factors operated at the levels of organization, facility-based service provider and frontline health worker. Engagement of end users during design phase, informed clinical decision making, utilization of mHealth evidence, employers' tolerance of some personal use of devices, automation of tasks and user-friendliness of application are key enabling factors for mHealth adoption in developing countries. On the contrary, absence of national policy on mHealth, poor knowledge base on mHealth, using two systems in parallel, duplication of efforts, poor Internet connectivity and shortage of electricity are important inhibiting factors for mHealth adoption. Conclusions: The review provides an insight about the challenges and opportunities related to mHealth adoption in developing countries. Implementation agencies should give careful consideration to these factors before designing and deploying any mHealth-enabled intervention. It is also important to understand the concept of incremental innovation so that resources spent on pilot interventions are optimized and full potential is achieved."
End-of-life decision-making for children with severe developmental disabilities: The parental perspective.	"Background and aims: The objectives of this integrative review were to understand how parents of children with severe developmental disorders experience their involvement in end-of-life decision-making, how they prefer to be involved and what factors influence their decisions. Methods and procedures: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO. The search was limited to articles in English or Dutch published between January 2004 and August 2014. We included qualitative and quantitative original studies that directly investigated the experiences of parents of children aged 0-18 years with severe developmental disorders for whom an end-of-life decision had been considered or made. Outcomes and results: We identified nine studies that met all inclusion criteria. Reportedly, parental involvement in end-of-life decision-making varied widely, ranging from having no involvement to being the sole decision-maker. Most parents preferred to actively share in the decision-making process regardless of their child's specific diagnosis or comorbidity. The main factors that influenced parents in their decision-making were: their strong urge to advocate for their child's best interests and to make the best (possible) decision. In addition, parents felt influenced by their child's visible suffering, remaining quality of life and the will they perceived in their child to survive. Conclusions and implications: Most parents of children with severe developmental disorders wish to actively share in the end-of-life decision-making process. An important emerging factor in this process is the parents' feeling that they have to stand up for their child's interests in conversations with the medical team."
Engagement in Behavioral Parent Training: Review of the Literature and Implications for Practice	"Engagement in behavioral parent training (BPT), including enrollment, attrition, attendance, within-session engagement, and homework completion, has long been a critical issue in the literature. Several estimates of various aspects of engagement have been suggested in the literature, but a systematic review of the available literature has never been accomplished. This review examines engagement data across 262 studies of BPT. Recruitment attrition, program attrition, attendance, and within-session engagement are examined across studies, with particular emphasis on the impact that SES, study purpose (efficacy vs. effectiveness), treatment format (individual vs. group), and age of child may have on those rates."
Engagement of parents in on-line social support interventions	"The purpose of this scoping review was to determine what the relevant research informs us about which parents of children with chronic disease and/or disability are likely to engage in an on-line social support program and why they choose to be engaged. The review included 16 peer-reviewed research reports about on-line social support offered to parents of children with chronic disease and/or disability. It was conducted using scoping review approaches recommended by H. Arskey and L. O'Malley (2005). A key finding of this review is that it appears that the development of on-line social support interventions for parents may not have integrated what is known in the field of Internet technology as necessary to engage users. This has implications for nurses wishing to provide on-line social support for parents. As well, it highlights future directions for research, including investigations of which parents are likely to engage in on-line social support interventions and the features of the intevention that will attract and sustain them as participants.

Engaging patients in health care decisions in the emergency department through shared decision-making: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Many decisions in the emergency department (ED) may benefit from patient involvement, even though this setting has been considered least conducive to shared decision-making (SDM). OBJECTIVES: The objective was to conduct a systematic review to evaluate the approaches, methods, and tools used to engage patients or their surrogates in SDM in the ED. METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched in conjunction with contacting content experts, reviewing selected bibliographies, and conducting citation searches using the Web of Knowledge database. Two reviewers independently selected eligible studies that addressed patient involvement and engagement in decision-making in the ED setting via the use of decision support interventions (DSIs), defined as decision aids or decision support designed to communicate probabilistic information on the risks and benefits of treatment options to patients as part of an SDM process. Eligible studies described and assessed at least one of the following outcomes: patient knowledge, experiences and perspectives on participating in treatment or management decisions, clinician or patient satisfaction, preference for involvement and/or degree of engagement in decision-making and treatment preferences, and clinical outcomes (e.g., rates of hospital admission/readmission, rates of medical or surgical interventions). Two reviewers extracted data on study characteristics, methodologic quality, and outcomes. The authors also assessed the extent to which SDM interventions adhered to good practice for the presentation of information on outcome probabilities (eight probability items from the International Patient Decision Aid Standards Instrument IPDASi]) and had comprehensive development processes. RESULTS: Five studies met inclusion criteria and were synthesized using a narrative approach. Each study was of satisfactory methodologic quality and used a DSI to engage patients or their surrogates in decision-making in the ED across four domains: 1) management options for children with small lacerations; 2) options for rehydrating children presenting with vomiting or diarrhea or both; 3) risk of bacteremia (and associated complications), tests, and treatment options for febrile children; and 4) short-term risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in adults with low-risk nontraumatic chest pain. Three studies had poor IPDASi probabilities and development process scores and lacked development informed by theory or involvement of clinicians and patients in development and usability testing. Overall, DSIs were associated with improvements in patients' knowledge and satisfaction with the explanation of their care, preferences for involvement, and engagement in decision-making and demonstrated utility for eliciting patients' preferences and values about management and treatment options. Two computerized DSIs (designed to predict risk of ACS in adults presenting to the ED with chest pain) were shown to reduce health care use without evidence of harm. None of the studies reported lack of feasibility of SDM in the ED. CONCLUSIONS: Early investigation of SDM in the ED suggests that patients may benefit from involvement in decision-making and offers no empirical evidence to suggest that SDM is not feasible. Future work is needed to develop and test additional SDM interventions in the ED and to identify contextual barriers and facilitators to implementation in practice.

Enhancing Participation in Depression Care in Outpatient Perinatal Care Settings: A Systematic Review	"OBJECTIVE: To examine a wide range of study designs and outcomes to estimate the extent to which interventions in outpatient perinatal care settings are associated with an increase in the uptake of depression care. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Scopus (EMBASE) were searched for studies published between 1999 and 2014 that evaluated mental health care use after screening for depression in perinatal care settings. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Inclusion criteria were: 1) English language; 2) pregnant and postpartum women who screened positive for depression; 3) exposure (validated depression screening in outpatient perinatal care setting); and, 4) outcome (mental health care use). Searches yielded 392 articles, 42 met criteria for full-text review, and 17 met inclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed using a modified Downs and Black scale. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Articles were independently reviewed by two abstractors and consensus reached. Study design, intervention components, and mental health care use were defined and categorized. Seventeen articles representing a range of study designs, including one randomized controlled trial and one cluster randomized controlled trial, were included. The average quality rating was 61% (31.0-90.0%). When no intervention was in place, an average of 22% (13.8-33.0%) of women who screened positive for depression had at least one mental health visit. The average rate of mental health care use was associated with a doubling of this rate with patient engagement strategies (44%, 29.0-90.0%), on-site assessments (49%, 25.2-90.0%), and perinatal care provider training (54%, 1.0-90.0%). High rates of mental health care use (81%, 72.0-90.0%) were associated with implementation of additional interventions, including resource provision to women, perinatal care provider training, on-site assessment, and access to mental health consultation for perinatal care providers. CONCLUSION: Screening alone was associated with 22% mental health care use among women who screened positive for depression; however, implementation of additional interventions was associated with a two to fourfold increased use of mental health care. Although definitive studies are still needed, screening done in conjunction with interventions that target patient, health care provider, and practice-level barriers is associated with increased improved rates of depression detection, assessment, referral, and treatment in perinatal care settings."
Enlight: A Comprehensive Quality and Therapeutic Potential Evaluation Tool for Mobile and Web-Based eHealth Interventions	"Background: Studies of criteria-based assessment tools have demonstrated the feasibility of objectively evaluating eHealth interventions independent of empirical testing. However, current tools have not included some quality constructs associated with intervention outcome, such as persuasive design, behavior change, or therapeutic alliance. In addition, the generalizability of such tools has not been explicitly examined.Objective: The aim is to introduce the development and further analysis of the Enlight suite of measures, developed to incorporate the aforementioned concepts and address generalizability aspects.Methods: As a first step, a comprehensive systematic review was performed to identify relevant quality rating criteria in line with the PRISMA statement. These criteria were then categorized to create Enlight. The second step involved testing Enlight on 42 mobile apps and 42 Web-based programs (delivery mediums) targeting modifiable behaviors related to medical illness or mental health (clinical aims).Results: A total of 476 criteria from 99 identified sources were used to build Enlight. The rating measures were divided into two sections: quality assessments and checklists. Quality assessments included usability, visual design, user engagement, content, therapeutic persuasiveness, therapeutic alliance, and general subjective evaluation. The checklists included credibility, privacy explanation, basic security, and evidence-based program ranking. The quality constructs exhibited excellent interrater reliability (intraclass correlations=.77-.98, median .91) and internal consistency (Cronbach alphas=.83-.90, median .88), with similar results when separated into delivery mediums or clinical aims. Conditional probability analysis revealed that 100% of the programs that received a score of fair or above (â3.0) in therapeutic persuasiveness or therapeutic alliance received the same range of scores in user engagement and content-a pattern that did not appear in the opposite direction. Preliminary concurrent validity analysis pointed to positive correlations of combined quality scores with selected variables. The combined score that did not include therapeutic persuasiveness and therapeutic alliance descriptively underperformed the other combined scores.Conclusions: This paper provides empirical evidence supporting the importance of persuasive design and therapeutic alliance within the context of a program's evaluation. Reliability metrics and preliminary concurrent validity analysis indicate the potential of Enlight in examining eHealth programs regardless of delivery mediums and clinical aims."
Enrolling and keeping participants in multiple sclerosis self-management interventions: a systematic review and meta-analysis	"OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to provide an estimate of expected enrolment and attrition rates based on published studies of existing self-management interventions for people with multiple sclerosis, and to identify contributing factors and impact on outcomes. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using Ovid MEDLINE, PsychINFO, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, OT Seeker, PubMed, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases. Controlled trials with or without randomization using either a between-group or within-person design were included if they met specified criteria. A random-effect meta-regression analysis was conducted to estimate the overall enrolment and attrition proportions, effect of person- and study-related factors, and impact on outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 48 studies, comprising 4446 persons were identified. The estimated enrolment rate was 50.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 49.6 to 51.1) and the estimated attrition rates in the intervention and control groups were 16.8% (95% CI: 16.2 to 17.3) and 14.4% (95% CI: 13.8 to 14.9), respectively. The main reported reason for refusing to participate was lack of interest (70.6%), while the reported reasons for dropping out were mainly owing to medical issues (26.1%) and disliking the intervention (17.9%). Trial, programme, and patient-related variables were found to influence the enrolment and/or attrition rates. Studies that had a 10% higher attrition rate had an effect size that was larger by 0.19 (95% CI: 0.17 to 0.24). CONCLUSION: Greater understanding of the factors associated with enrolment and attrition rates would help in planning and developing a more appealing self-management intervention that patients can easily accept and incorporate into their everyday lives."
Establishing partnership with traditional birth attendants for improved maternal and newborn health: A review of factors influencing implementation.	"Background: Recent World Health Organization recommendations recognize the important role Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) can play in supporting the health of women and newborns. This paper provides an analysis of key factors that affect the implementation of interventions to develop partnerships with TBAs to promote improved access to skilled care at birth. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of 20 papers identified through two systematic reviews that examined the effectiveness of interventions to find new roles for TBAs on maternal and newborn health outcomes, as well as papers identified through a systematic mapping of the maternal health literature. The Supporting the Use of Research Evidence framework (SURE) guided the thematic analysis to explore the perceptions of various stakeholders and implementation barriers and facilitators, as well as other contextual issues. Results: This analysis identified countries that have implemented interventions to support the transition from birth with a TBA to birth with a skilled birth attendant. Drawing on the experiences of these countries, the analysis highlights factors that are important to consider when designing and implementing such interventions. Barriers to implementation included resistance to change in more traditional communities, negative attitudes between TBAs and skilled attendants and TBAs concerns about the financial implications of assuming new roles. Facilitating factors included stakeholder involvement in devising and implementing interventions, knowledge sharing between TBAs and skilled birth attendants, and formalised roles and responsibilities and remuneration for TBAs. Conclusions: The implementation barriers identified in this analysis could, if not addressed, prevent or discourage TBAs from carrying out newly defined roles supporting women in pregnancy and childbirth and linking them to the formal health system. This paper also identifies the factors that seem critical to success, which new programmes could consider adopting from the outset. In most cases a multi-faceted approach is needed to prepare TBAs and others for new roles, including the training of TBAs to strengthen their knowledge and skills to enable them to be able to assume new roles, alongside the sensitization of healthcare providers, communities, women and their families. Further research is required to map the transition process and stakeholder experiences in more detailed ways and to provide longer-term monitoring of existing interventions."
Ethical Challenges in Community-Based Participatory Research: A Scoping Review	"Ethical challenges in community-based participatory research (CBPR) are of increasing interest to researchers; however, it is not known how widespread these challenges are or how extensively the topic has been explored. Using Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review method, studies on ethical challenges in CBPR were mapped. Findings indicate that researchers continue to raise questions about ethics associated with CBPR. Our purpose in this article is to present a thematic summary of international ethical challenges as a guide for researchers interested in community participatory approaches and to better prepare them for qualitative health research with communities."
Ethical considerations of community-based participatory research: Contextual underpinnings for developing countries.	"Background: The nature of community-based participatory research (CBPR) poses distinctive ethical challenges. In the absence of organized guidelines, a remarkable amount of researchers' time and energy will be spent tackling these ethical challenges. The study aimed to explore ethical issues and principles potentially arising when conducting CBPR. Methods: This qualitative study conducted in CBPR Center of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Required data were gathered through systematic literature review and semi-structured interviews. Representatives of community, academia, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) participated in our study. Ten interviews with representatives of partner organizations, four group interviews with academic staff, and four with representatives of community were conducted. Repeated thematic analysis was used to elicit ethics-related overarching themes from transcribed interviews. As recommendations, these themes were then organized into a set of CBPR-related ethical issues and principles. Results: Four CBPR ethical guidelines (including 173 articles) were selected from a systematic review. Overarching themes relating to ethical principles which emerged from interviews were as follows: Trust, transparency and accountability, equity and inclusion, power imbalance, tolerance and conflict management, and attention to cultural sensitivity. Practical principles that emerged included: Consensus rather than informed consent, ownership of data and research achievements, and sustainability and maintenance of relationships. According to findings and in comparison to international guidelines, the present study put more emphasis on cultural sensitivity and sustainability as CBPR ethical tangles. Conclusions: Community-based participatory research ethical challenges are of the same kind in most parts of the world. However, some discrepancies exist that calls for local scrutiny. Future use and critic of current explored ethical issues and principles are highly encouraged."
Ethical issues in using the internet to engage participants in family and child research: A scoping review	"BACKGROUND: The internet is an increasingly popular tool in family and child research that is argued to pose new ethical challenges, yet few studies have systematically assessed the ethical issues of engaging parents and children in research online. This scoping review aims to identify and integrate evidence on the ethical issues reported when recruiting, retaining and tracing families and children in research online, and to identify ethical guidelines for internet research. METHODS: Academic literature was searched using electronic academic databases (Scopus, PsycINFO, Embase, ERIC, CINAHL and Informit) and handsearching reference lists for articles published in English between January 2006 and February 2016. Grey literature was searched using Google to identify relevant ethical guidelines. RESULTS: Sixty-five academic articles were included after screening 3,537 titles and abstracts and 205 full-text articles. Most articles reported using the internet to recruit participants (88%) with few reporting online retention (12%) or tracing (10%). Forty percent commented on ethical issues; the majority did not discuss ethics beyond general consent or approval procedures. Some ethical concerns were specific to engaging minors online, including parental consent, age verification and children's vulnerability. Other concerns applied when engaging any research participant online, including privacy and confidentiality, informed consent and disparities in internet access. Five professional guidelines and 10 university guidelines on internet research ethics were identified. Few academic articles (5%) reported using these guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Engaging families and children in research online introduces unique challenges requiring careful consideration. While researchers regarded themselves as responsible for ensuring research is conducted ethically, lack of use of available guidelines and limited academic literature suggests internet research is occurring without suitable guidance. We recommend broad dissemination of ethical guidelines and encourage researchers to report the methodological and ethical issues of using the internet to engage families and children in research."
Ethical practices in community-based research in non-suicidal self-injury: A systematic review	"BACKGROUND: The growing interest in community-based research on non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) reflects the high prevalence rates found among vulnerable adolescents and young adults. A significant concern in research with vulnerable populations, and on sensitive topics, is the development of an ethical framework that protects the needs and rights of the participants while responding to researchers' goals and limitations and the broader clinical and public health concerns. AIM: The aim of the present study was to review the ethical practices followed in community-based research on NSSI. METHOD: A systematic review of literature was conducted, based on PRISMA guidelines, on community-based surveys in NSSI, published between 1995 and 2016. A total of 93 studies were included in the review. RESULTS: The results examine a range of ethical issues; the procedures for consent and assent for study participation, protection of confidentiality and the limits of confidentiality, assessment of imminent risk of suicide and subsequent processes, and debriefing measures. The interaction between the study characteristics and the reported ethical procedures has been examined, with a focus on participant age, study design (cross-sectional or longitudinal), survey modality (paper-based survey or online survey) and primary variable/s of interest (only NSSI or NSSI and suicidal ideation/behavior) under study. The review describes the typical ethical practices in community-based research on NSSI, identifies the gaps in the existing literature, and has implications for the formulation of best-practice guidelines.

"Ethics and Community Involvement in Syntheses Concerning American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian Health: A Systematic Review."	"BACKGROUND: The objective of the research was to review reporting of ethical concerns and community involvement in peer-reviewed systematic reviews or meta-analyses concerning American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian (AI/AN/NH) health. METHODS: Text words and indexed vocabulary terms were used to query PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and the Native Health Database for systematic reviews or meta-analyses concerning AI/AN/NH health published in peer-reviewed journals, followed by a search through reference lists. Each article was abstracted by two independent reviewers; results were discussed until consensus was reached. RESULTS: We identified 107 papers published from 1986-2012 that were primarily about AI/AN/NH health or presented findings separately for AI/AN/NH communities. Two reported seeking indigenous reviewer feedback; none reported seeking input from tribes and communities. Approximately 7% reported on institutional review board (IRB) approval of included studies, 5% reported on tribal approval, and 4% referenced the sovereignty of AI/AN tribes. Approximately 63% used evidence from more than one AI/AN/NH population study, and 28% discussed potential benefits to communities from the synthesis research. CONCLUSIONS: Reporting of ethics and community involvement are not prominent. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses making community-level inferences may pose risks to communities. Future systematic reviews and meta-analyses should consider ethical and participatory dimensions of research."
European League Against Rheumatism recommendations for the inclusion of patient representatives in scientific projects.	"OBJECTIVE: To develop recommendations to enable successful inclusion of the patient perspective in European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)-funded scientific research projects. METHODS: The EULAR standardised operational procedures for guideline development were followed. A systematic literature review was presented during a first task force meeting, including 3 rheumatologists, 1 rheumatologist/epidemiologist, 2 allied health professionals, 2 representatives of arthritis research organisations and 7 patient representatives, resulting in 38 statements. A Delphi method was carried out to reduce and refine the statements and agree on a set of eight. Next, a survey among a wider group of experts, professionals and patient representatives (n=42), was completed. Feedback from this wider group was discussed at the second meeting and integrated in the final wording of the recommendations. Subsequently, the level of agreement of the group of experts (n=81) was re-evaluated. RESULTS: The project resulted in a definition of patient research partner and agreement on a set of eight recommendations for their involvement in research projects. These recommendations provide practical guidance for organising patient participation, capturing (1) the role of patient research partners, (2) phase of involvement, (3) the recommended number, (4) recruitment, (5) selection, (6) support, (7) training and (8) acknowledgement. CONCLUSION: Collaboration between patients and professionals in research is relatively new. Trials or effectiveness studies are not yet available. Nevertheless, it is possible to define recommendations for the inclusion of patients in research following a solid expert opinion based consensus process."
Evaluating Progression-Free Survival as a Surrogate Outcome for Health-Related Quality of Life in Oncology: A Systematic Review and Quantitative Analysis.	"Importance: Progression-free survival (PFS) has become a commonly used outcome to assess the efficacy of new cancer drugs. However, it is not clear if delay in progression leads to improved quality of life with or without overall survival benefit. Objective: To evaluate the association between PFS and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in oncology through a systematic review and quantitative analysis of published randomized clinical trials. Eligible trials addressed oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, or intrapleural chemotherapy or biological treatments, and reported PFS or health-related quality of life. Data Sources: For this systematic review and quantitative analysis of randomized clinical trials of patients with cancer, we searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 1, 2000, through May 4, 2016. Study Selection: Paired reviewers independently screened citations, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias of included studies. Data Extraction and Synthesis: We examined the association of difference in median PFS duration (in months) between treatment groups with difference in global, physical, and emotional HRQoL scores between groups (standardized to a range of 0-100, with higher scores representing better HRQoL) using weighted simple regressions. Main Outcome and Measure: The association between PFS duration and HRQoL. Results: Of 35960 records screened, 52 articles reporting on 38 randomized clinical trials involving 13979 patients across 12 cancer types using 6 different HRQoL instruments were included. The mean (SD) difference in median PFS between the intervention and the control arms was 1.91 (3.35) months. The mean (SD) differences in change of HRQoL adjusted to per-month values were -0.39 (3.59) for the global domain, 0.26 (5.56) for the physical domain, and 1.08 (3.49) for the emotional domain. The slope of the association between the difference in median PFS and the difference in change for global HRQoL (n = 30 trials) was 0.12 (95% CI, -0.27 to 0.52); for physical HRQoL (n = 20 trials) it was -0.20 (95% CI, -0.62 to 0.23); and for emotional HRQoL (n = 13 trials) it was 0.78 (95% CI, -0.05 to 1.60). Conclusions and Relevance: We failed to find a significant association between PFS and HRQoL in cancer clinical trials. These findings raise questions regarding the assumption that interventions prolonging PFS also improve HRQoL in patients with cancer. Therefore, to ensure that patients are truly obtaining important benefit from cancer therapies, clinical trial investigators should measure HRQoL directly and accurately, ensuring adequate duration and follow-up."
Evaluating the Addition of Hatha Yoga in Cardiac Rehabilitation	"Introduction The practice of yoga is one of several complementary therapies found effective in improving the emotional health and well-being of cardiac patients. Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine effects of a weekly hatha yoga intervention on perceived stress and quality of life (QOL) in patients in phase 2 cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Methods A quasi-experimental design was used. Forty patients participated in the hatha yoga intervention in addition to the standard CR program, and 40 patients participated in the standard CR program. Perceived stress was measured before and after the intervention using the Perceived Stress Scale. QOL was measured using the Darmouth CO-OP Assessment tool (CO-OP). Findings The intervention group demonstrated a significant improvement in per- ceived stress T (39)=2.989, p=0.005 and QOL T (39)=3.16, p=0.003. The control group showed no improvement in scores in perceived stress T (39)= -0.99, p=0.33, and QOL T(39)=1.04, p=0.30. Conclusion Yoga can be beneficial as an addition to conventional rehabilitation of cardiac patients. Nurses can be pivotal in the introduction of yoga therapy in CR."
Evaluating the effectiveness of sexual and reproductive health services during humanitarian crises: A systematic review	"BACKGROUND: An estimated 32 million women and girls of reproductive age living in emergency situations, all of whom require sexual and reproductive health (SRH) information and services. This systematic review assessed the effect of SRH interventions, including the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) on a range of health outcomes from the onset of emergencies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We searched EMBASE, Global Health, MEDLINE and PsychINFO databases from January 1, 1980 to April 10, 2017. This review was registered with the PROSPERO database with identifier number CRD42017082102. We found 29 studies meet the inclusion criteria. We found high quality evidence to support the effectiveness of specific SRH interventions, such as home visits and peer-led educational and counselling, training of lower-level health care providers, community health workers (CHWs) to promote SRH services, a three-tiered network of health workers providing reproductive and maternal health services, integration of HIV and SRH services, and men's discussion groups for reducing intimate partner violence. We found moderate quality evidence to support transport-based referral systems, community-based SRH education, CHW delivery of injectable contraceptives, wider literacy programmes, and birth preparedness interventions. No studies reported interventions related to fistulae, and only one study focused on abortion services. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased attention to SRH in humanitarian crises, the sector has made little progress in advancing the evidence base for the effectiveness of SRH interventions, including the MISP, in crisis settings. A greater quantity and quality of more timely research is needed to ascertain the effectiveness of delivering SRH interventions in a variety of humanitarian crises."
Evaluating the Impact of Physical Activity Apps and Wearables: Interdisciplinary Review	"BACKGROUND: Although many smartphone apps and wearables have been designed to improve physical activity, their rapidly evolving nature and complexity present challenges for evaluating their impact. Traditional methodologies, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), can be slow. To keep pace with rapid technological development, evaluations of mobile health technologies must be efficient. Rapid alternative research designs have been proposed, and efficient in-app data collection methods, including in-device sensors and device-generated logs, are available. Along with effectiveness, it is important to measure engagement (ie, users' interaction and usage behavior) and acceptability (ie, users' subjective perceptions and experiences) to help explain how and why apps and wearables work. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to (1) explore the extent to which evaluations of physical activity apps and wearables: employ rapid research designs; assess engagement, acceptability, as well as effectiveness; use efficient data collection methods; and (2) describe which dimensions of engagement and acceptability are assessed. METHOD: An interdisciplinary scoping review using 8 databases from health and computing sciences. Included studies measured physical activity, and evaluated physical activity apps or wearables that provided sensor-based feedback. Results were analyzed using descriptive numerical summaries, chi-square testing, and qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1829 abstracts were screened, and 858 articles read in full. Of 111 included studies, 61 (55.0%) were published between 2015 and 2017. Most (55.0%, 61/111) were RCTs, and only 2 studies (1.8%) used rapid research designs: 1 single-case design and 1 multiphase optimization strategy. Other research designs included 23 (22.5%) repeated measures designs, 11 (9.9%) nonrandomized group designs, 10 (9.0%) case studies, and 4 (3.6%) observational studies. Less than one-third of the studies (32.0%, 35/111) investigated effectiveness, engagement, and acceptability together. To measure physical activity, most studies (90.1%, 101/111) employed sensors (either in-device 67.6%, 75/111] or external 23.4%, 26/111]). RCTs were more likely to employ external sensors (accelerometers: P=.005). Studies that assessed engagement (52.3%, 58/111) mostly used device-generated logs (91%, 53/58) to measure the frequency, depth, and length of engagement. Studies that assessed acceptability (57.7%, 64/111) most often used questionnaires (64%, 42/64) and/or qualitative methods (53%, 34/64) to explore appreciation, perceived effectiveness and usefulness, satisfaction, intention to continue use, and social acceptability. Some studies (14.4%, 16/111) assessed dimensions more closely related to usability (ie, burden of sensor wear and use, interface complexity, and perceived technical performance). CONCLUSIONS: The rapid increase of research into the impact of physical activity apps and wearables means that evaluation guidelines are urgently needed to promote efficiency through the use of rapid research designs, in-device sensors and user-logs to assess effectiveness, engagement, and acceptability. Screening articles was time-consuming because reporting across health and computing sciences lacked standardization. Reporting guidelines are therefore needed to facilitate the synthesis of evidence across disciplines. Copyright ¬©Claire McCallum, John Rooksby, Cindy M Gray.

Evaluating the mechanisms of change in motivational interviewing in the treatment of mental health problems: A review and meta-analysis	"Motivational interviewing (MI) has proven useful in the treatment of a variety of mental health problems, however the mechanisms of MI's success within these populations remain unknown. This review is a first attempt to investigate and meta-analyse MI mechanisms of change research conducted with participants who suffer mood, anxiety, psychotic, eating disorders, and comorbid conditions. Twenty studies met inclusion criteria and examined a range of potential MI mechanisms, including patient motivation and confidence, patient resistance, and engagement."
Evaluation of Patient and Family Engagement Strategies to Improve Medication Safety	"Background: Patient and family engagement (PFE) is critical for patient safety. We systematically reviewed types of PFE strategies implemented and their impact on medication safety.Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists and websites to August 2016. Two investigators independently reviewed all abstracts and articles, and articles were additionally reviewed by two senior investigators for selection. One investigator abstracted data and two investigators reviewed the data for accuracy. Study quality was determined by consensus. Investigators developed a framework for defining the level of patient engagement: informing patients about medications (Level 1), informing about engagement with health care providers (Level 2), empowering patients with communication tools and skills (Level 3), partnering with patients in their care (Level 4), and integrating patients as full care team members (Level 5).Results: We included 19¬studies that mostly targeted older adults taking multiple medications. The median level of engagement was 2, ranging from 2-4. We identified no level 5 studies. Key themes for patient engagement strategies impacting medication safety were patient education and medication reconciliation, with a subtheme of patient portals. Most studies (84%) reported implementation outcomes. The most commonly reported medication safety outcomes were medication errors, including near misses and discrepancies (47%), and medication safety knowledge (37%). Most studies (63%) were of medium to low quality, and risk of bias was generally moderate. Among the 11 studies with control groups, 55% (n¬=¬6) reported statistically significant improvement on at least one medication safety outcome. Further synthesis of medication safety measures was limited due to intervention and outcome heterogeneity.Conclusions: Key strategies for engaging patients in medication safety are education and medication reconciliation. Patient engagement levels were generally low, as defined by a¬novel framework for determining levels of patient engagement. As more patient engagement studies are conducted, this framework should be evaluated for associations with patient outcomes."
Evidence Base Update on the Treatment of Early Childhood Anxiety and Related Problems.	"The controlled evaluation of treatments for early childhood anxiety and related problems has been a relatively recent area of investigation, and accordingly, trials examining early childhood anxiety treatment have not been well represented in existing systematic reviews of youth anxiety treatments. This Evidence Base Update provides the first systematic review of evidence supporting interventions specifically for the treatment of early childhood anxiety and related problems. Thirty articles testing 38 treatments in samples with mean age < 7.9 years (N = 2,228 children) met inclusion criteria. We applied Southam-Gerow and Prinstein's (2014) review criteria, which classifies families of treatments according to one of five levels of empirical support-Well-Established, Probably Efficacious, Possibly Efficacious, Experimental, and of Questionable Efficacy. We found family-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to be a Well-Established treatment, and Group Parent CBT and Group Parent CBT + Group Child CBT to both be Probably Efficacious treatments. In contrast, play therapy and attachment-based therapy are still only Experimental treatments for early childhood anxiety, relaxation training has Questionable Efficacy, and there is no evidence to date to speak to the efficacy of individual child CBT and/or medication in younger anxious children. All 3 currently supported interventions for early childhood anxiety entail exposure-based CBT with significant parental involvement. This conclusion meaningfully differs from conclusions for treating anxiety in older childhood that highlight the well-established efficacy of individual child CBT and/or medication and that question whether parental involvement in treatment enhances outcomes."
Evidence supporting the best clinical management of patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy: a systematic guideline review and expert consensus.	"The complexity and heterogeneity of patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy renders traditional disease-oriented guidelines often inadequate and complicates clinical decision making. To address this challenge, guidelines have been developed on multimorbidity or polypharmacy. To systematically analyse their recommendations, we conducted a systematic guideline review using the Ariadne principles for managing multimorbidity as analytical framework. The information synthesis included a multistep consensus process involving 18 multidisciplinary experts from seven countries. We included eight guidelines (four each on multimorbidity and polypharmacy) and extracted about 250 recommendations. The guideline addressed (i) the identification of the target population (risk factors); (ii) the assessment of interacting conditions and treatments: medical history, clinical and psychosocial assessment including physiological status and frailty, reviews of medication and encounters with healthcare providers highlighting informational continuity; (iii) the need to incorporate patient preferences and goal setting: eliciting preferences and expectations, the process of shared decision making in relation to treatment options and the level of involvement of patients and carers; (iv) individualized management: guiding principles on optimization of treatment benefits over possible harms, treatment communication and the information content of medication/care plans; (v) monitoring and follow-up: strategies in care planning, self-management and medication-related aspects, communication with patients including safety instructions and adherence, coordination of care regarding referral and discharge management, medication appropriateness and safety concerns. The spectrum of clinical and self-management issues varied from guiding principles to specific recommendations and tools providing actionable support. The limited availability of reliable risk prediction models, feasible interventions of proven effectiveness and decision aids, and limited consensus on appropriate outcomes of care highlight major research deficits. An integrated approach to both multimorbidity and polypharmacy should be considered in future guidelines. Copyright ¬© 2018 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine."
Evidence-based clinical guidelines on medication therapy for juvenile idiopathic arthritis: A systematic review.	"Objective To systematically assess the quality of evidence-based clinical guidelines on the treatment of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and to compare the differences and similarities between recommendations, so as to provide references for clinical application. Methods Databases such as the TRIP, PubMed, CNKI, VIP, WanFang Data, CBM, U.S National Guideline Clearinghouse and Guidelines International Network were searched to collect evidence-based guidelines on medication therapy for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Methodological quality of included guidelines was assessed according to the AGREE II instrument, and differences and similarities among recommendations were compared. Results Two evidence-based clinical guidelines from Australia and China were included. Among 6 domains of the Australian guideline which were rated using AGREE II instrument, ""scope and purpose"", ""stakeholder involvement"", ""rigor of development"", ""clarity and presentation"", ""applicability"" and ""editorial independence"" were scored more than 50%. As for Chinese guideline, ""scope and purpose"", ""stakeholder involvement"", ""rigor of development"", ""clarity and presentation"" and ""editorial independence"" was all scored more than 50%, but ""applicability"" was scored less than 50%. Conclusion The included guidelines are of high quality and strongly recommended, but the recommendations might exist limitation for Chinese children. Thus, the development of relevant Chinese evidence-based guidelines are urgently needed."
Evidence-Based Interventions for Transitions in Care for Individuals Living With Dementia	"Background and Objectives: Despite numerous, often predictable, transitions in care, little is known about the core elements of successful transitions in care specifically for persons with dementia. The paper examines available evidence-based interventions to improve the care transitions for persons with dementia and their caregivers. Research Design and Methods: A state-of-the-art review was conducted for research published on interventions targeting transitions in care for persons living with dementia and their caregivers through January 2017. Results: Our review revealed seven evidence-based interventions to postpone/prevent or reduce care transitions specific to persons living with dementia. Effective approaches appear to be those that involve the individual and caregiver in establishing goals of care, educate the individual and caregiver about likely transitions in care; provide timely communication of information about the individual, create strong inter professional teams with competencies in dementia care, and implement evidence-based models of practice. Discussion and Implications: Five essential features for consistent and supported care transitions for persons with dementia and their caregivers are recommended. Findings reinforce the need for additional research and adaptation of evidence-based transitions in care interventions."
Evidence-based obesity treatment interventions for Latino adults in the U.S.: a systematic review	"Context: Latinos have one of the highest prevalences of obesity in the U.S. Efforts to address U.S. Latino health have expanded to include obesity prevention and treatment initiatives. The objectives of this review were to (1) conduct a systematic review of obesity-related treatment interventions targeting U.S. Latino adults and (2) develop evidence-based recommendations to inform culturally relevant strategies for obesity treatment targeting U.S. Latino adults. Evidence acquisition: Obesity treatment interventions, published between 1990 and 2010, were identified through a systematic search of electronic databases conducted between January 2010 and December 2011. Details of the screening process and selection/exclusion criteria are reported in the Guide to Obesity Prevention in Latin America and the U.S. (GOL) parent study. Evidence synthesis: Of the 325 studies identified in the GOL parent study, 105 met the inclusion criteria, and 22 involved obesity treatment interventions for Latinos and were included in the present review. The 22 studies were evaluated (between January 2010 and December 2011) for strength of study design and execution; effect sizes were also estimated for treatment effects on obesity-related outcomes. Interventions for physical activity or diet behavioral changes with strong or sufficient evidence included (1) community-based, culturally relevant, RCTs, and non-randomized controlled trials; (2) church-based interventions; and (3) promotora-led interventions. Conclusions: Most interventions targeted physical activity and/or diet behavioral modification in Latinas and were led by bicultural/bilingual professionals. Potential key intervention settings include community clinics/centers and churches. Although there was limited literature on obesity treatment interventions for U.S. Latinos, the review findings provide valuable insight to researchers and practitioners involved in obesity treatment for U.S. Latino adults."
Evidence-Based Parenting Interventions to Promote Secure Attachment: Findings From a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	"Various interventions are used in clinical practice to address insecure or disorganized attachment patterns and attachment disorders. The most common of these are parenting interventions, but not all have a robust empirical evidence base. We undertook a systematic review of randomized trials comparing a parenting intervention with a control, where these used a validated attachment instrument, in order to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of interventions aiming to improve attachment in children with severe attachment problems (mean age <13 years). This article aims to inform clinicians about the parenting interventions included in our systematic review that were clinically effective in promoting secure attachment. For completeness, we also briefly discuss other interventions without randomized controlled trial evidence, identified in Patient Public Involvement workshops and expert groups at the point our review was completed as being used or recommended. We outline the key implications of our findings for clinical practice and future research."
"Evidence-based review of trauma center care and routine palliative care processes for geriatric trauma patients; A collaboration from the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Patient Assessment Committee, the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Geriatric Trauma Committee, and the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma Guidelines Committee."	"BACKGROUND Despite an aging population and increasing number of geriatric trauma patients annually, gaps in our understanding of best practices for geriatric trauma patients persist. We know that trauma center care improves outcomes for injured patients generally, and palliative care processes can improve outcomes for disease-specific conditions, and our goal was to determine effectiveness of these interventions on outcomes for geriatric trauma patients. METHODS A priori questions were created regarding outcomes for patients 65 years or older with respect to care at trauma centers versus nontrauma centers and use of routine palliative care processes. A query of MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE was performed. Letters to the editor, case reports, book chapters, and review articles were excluded. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology was used to perform a systematic review and create recommendations. RESULTS We reviewed seven articles relevant to trauma center care and nine articles reporting results on palliative care processes as they related to geriatric trauma patients. Given data quality and limitations, we conditionally recommend trauma center care for the severely injured geriatric trauma patients but are unable to make a recommendation on the question of routine palliative care processes for geriatric trauma patients. CONCLUSIONS As our older adult population increases, injured geriatric patients will continue to pose challenges for care, such as comorbidities or frailty. We found that trauma center care was associated with improved outcomes for geriatric trauma patients in most studies and that utilization of early palliative care consultations was generally associated with improved secondary outcomes, such as length of stay; however, inconsistency and imprecision prevented us from making a clear recommendation for this question. As caregivers, we should ensure adequate support for trauma systems and palliative care processes in our institutions and communities and continue to support robust research to study these and other aspects of geriatric trauma.

Examining Factors of Engagement With Digital Interventions for Weight Management: Rapid Review.	"BACKGROUND: Digital interventions for weight management provide a unique opportunity to target daily lifestyle choices and eating behaviors over a sustained period of time. However, recent evidence has demonstrated a lack of user engagement with digital health interventions, impacting on the levels of intervention effectiveness. Thus, it is critical to identify the factors that may facilitate user engagement with digital health interventions to encourage behavior change and weight management. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify and synthesize the available evidence to gain insights about users' perspectives on factors that affect engagement with digital interventions for weight management. METHODS: A rapid review methodology was adopted. The search strategy was executed in the following databases: Web of Science, PsycINFO, and PubMed. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they investigated users' engagement with a digital weight management intervention and were published from 2000 onwards. A narrative synthesis of data was performed on all included studies. RESULTS: A total of 11 studies were included in the review. The studies were qualitative, mixed-methods, or randomized controlled trials. Some of the studies explored features influencing engagement when using a Web-based digital intervention, others specifically explored engagement when accessing a mobile phone app, and some looked at engagement after text message (short message service, SMS) reminders. Factors influencing engagement with digital weight management interventions were found to be both user-related (eg, perceived health benefits) and digital intervention-related (eg, ease of use and the provision of personalized information). CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the importance of incorporating user perspectives during the digital intervention development process to encourage engagement. The review contributes to our understanding of what facilitates user engagement and points toward a coproduction approach for developing digital interventions for weight management. Particularly, it highlights the importance of thinking about user-related and digital tool-related factors from the very early stages of the intervention development process.

Examining the characteristics of health-related gaming interventions among congenital heart disease patients: A scoping review	"Resources to support persons living with congenital heart disease are limited, and consist primarily of patient education booklets. However, these resources fail to provide opportunities for social and/or group interaction. Health related gaming is an alternative medium for the delivery of patient education materials. To date, these types of interventions have been used throughout the healthcare environment, however no extensive review has been conducted to determine the characteristics of these interventions. The aim of this scoping review was to summarize and disseminate research findings, to identify research gaps, and to make recommendations for future intervention design and evaluation. Forty-two articles were included in this review. None of the studies used interventions that incorporated individuals living with congenital heart disease or the use of multi-player online gaming options. Additional testing of these interventions using a variety of populations, in a number of settings, and incorporating multi-player options is required."
Exercise Affects Cardiopulmonary Function in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease: A Meta-Analysis	"This study aimed to comprehensively assess the effects of exercise on cardiopulmonary function indices in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). A literature review was performed by searching literatures in PubMed and Embase before June 2016. Studies were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, followed by data extraction and a quality assessment of the included studies using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Correlations between exercise and cardiopulmonary function indices pulse wave velocity, respiratory exchange ratio, and peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak)] were then evaluated using mean differences and 95% confidence intervals. All meta-analyses were conducted using R 3.12 software. Finally, five eligible studies involving 179 CKD patients were included. After intervention, a heterogeneity test showed that the VO2 peak values of the treatment group were greater than those of the control group, whereas no significant differences were found for the other indices. However, a sensitivity analysis showed inconsistent results both before and after intervention. Thus, we concluded that exercise might play an important role in improving the VO2 peak values in CKD patients. Additional studies are needed to verify this conclusion."
Exercise alone or combined with dietary supplements for sarcopenic obesity in community-dwelling older people: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials	"Sarcopenic obesity (SO) represents a major public health concern. Physical activity has been recommended to minimize functional decline in the elderly and it may also be relevant to SO management. The purpose of this systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to investigate the effects of different exercise modalities, alone or combined with nutritional supplementation, on body composition, muscle strength and physical function in healthy community-dwelling older adults with SO. A literature search was performed using the PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL and Cochrane Plus databases. The main inclusion criteria were that the papers were English-language reports of RCTs involving healthy community-dwelling adults aged >=60 years with SO. The initial search identified 2073 publications from the 4 databases and 72 additional records; 42 full-text records were assessed for eligibility and 8 articles were finally included. The search was conducted from December 1, 2017 to January 8, 2018. The types of exercises were resistance and aerobic training, either alone or combined, and whole-body electromyostimulation. Protein supplementation was included in three studies. The diversity of the methodologies employed and of the results observed does not allow us to reach a clear conclusion. Whereas five of the studies reported improvements in obesity, results were contradictory concerning muscle mass. Increases in muscle strength appeared especially with resistance training and do not seem to be linked to protein supplementation. On the other hand, improvements in physical function were reported in programs combining aerobic and resistance training with nutritional supplementation. We believe that it is of the utmost importance that a certain degree of homogeneity is kept concerning the methods and criteria used in the diagnosis of SO, so that the effects of specific physical exercise programs, whether alone or combined with nutritional supplements, can be assessed with precision.

Exercise for people with peripheral neuropathy.	"Background Peripheral neuropathies are a wide range of diseases affecting the peripheral nerves. Demyelination or axonal degeneration gives rise to a variety of symptoms including reduced or altered sensation, pain, muscle weakness and fatigue. Secondary disability arises and this may result in adjustments to psychological and social function. Exercise therapy, with a view to developing strength and stamina, forms part of the treatment for people with peripheral neuropathy, particularly in the later stages of recovery from acute neuropathy and in chronic neuropathies. Objectives The primary objective was to examine the effect of exercise therapy on functional ability in the treatment of people with peripheral neuropathy. In addition, secondary outcomes of muscle strength, endurance, broader measures of health and well being, as well as unfavourable outcomes were examined. Search strategy In September 2009 we updated the searches of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group register, MEDLINE (from January 1966), EMBASE (from January 1980), CINAHL (from January 1982) and LILACS (from January 1982). Bibliographies of all selected randomised controlled trials were checked and authors contacted to identify additional published or unpublished data. Selection criteria Any randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trial in people with peripheral neuropathy comparing the effect of exercise therapy with no exercise therapy or drugs or an alternative non-drug treatment on functional ability (or disability) for at least eight weeks after randomisation was included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected eligible studies, rated the methodological quality and extracted data. Main results Only one trial fully met the inclusion criteria. An additional two trials assessed outcomes less than eight weeks after randomisation and were also included. Methodological quality was poor for several criteria in each study. Data used in the three studies could not be pooled due to heterogeneity of diagnostic groups and outcome measures. The results of the included trials failed to show any effect of strengthening and endurance exercise programmes on functional ability in people with peripheral neuropathy. However, there is some evidence that strengthening exercise programmes were moderately effective in increasing the strength of tested muscles. Authors' conclusions There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of exercise on functional ability in people with peripheral neuropathy. The results suggest that progressive resisted exercise may improve muscle strength in affected muscles."
Exercise for preventing falls in older people living in the community.	"Background At least one-third of community-dwelling people over 65 years of age fall each year. Exercises that target balance, gait and muscle strength have been found to prevent falls in these people. An up-to-date synthesis of the evidence is important given the major long-term consequences associated with falls and fall-related injuries Objectives To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of exercise interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases and two trial registers up to 2 May 2018, together with reference checking and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of any form of exercise as a single intervention on falls in people aged 60+ years living in the community. We excluded trials focused on particular conditions, such as stroke. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was rate of falls. Main results We included 108 RCTs with 23,407 participants living in the community in 25 countries. There were nine cluster-RCTs. On average, participants were 76 years old and 77% were women. Most trials had unclear or high risk of bias for one or more items. Results from four trials focusing on people who had been recently discharged from hospital and from comparisons of different exercises are not described here. Authors' conclusions Exercise programmes reduce the rate of falls and the number of people experiencing falls in older people living in the community (high-certainty evidence). The effects of such exercise programmes are uncertain for other non-falls outcomes. Where reported, adverse events were predominantly non-serious."
Exercise for the management of cancer-related fatigue in adults.	"Background Cancer-related fatigue is recognised as an important symptom associated with cancer and its treatment. A number of studies have investigated the effects of physical activity in reducing cancer-related fatigue. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in The Cochrane Library (2008, Issue 1). The original review identified some benefits of physical activity on fatigue in cancer both during and after adjuvant treatment. We identified a number of limitations in the evidence, providing clear justification for an updated review. Objectives To evaluate the effect of exercise on cancer-related fatigue both during and after cancer treatment. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 1, 2011), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2011), EMBASE (1980 to March 2011), CINAHL (1982 to March 2011), British Nursing Index (January 1984 to March 2011), AMED (1985 to March 2011), SIGLE (1980 to March 2011) and Dissertation Abstracts International (1861 to March 2011) using key words. We also searched reference lists off all studies identified for inclusion and relevant reviews. In addition, we handsearched relevant journals and contacted experts in the field of cancer-related fatigue. Selection criteria We sought and included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effect of exercise on cancer-related fatigue in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of studies and extracted data based upon predefined criteria. Where data were available we performed meta-analyses for fatigue using a random-effects model. Main results For this update we identified a total of 56 studies (4068 participants) for inclusion (28 from the original search and 28 from the updated search), with the majority carried out in participants with breast cancer (28 studies). A meta-analysis of all fatigue data, incorporating 38 comparisons, provided data for 1461 participants who received an exercise intervention and 1187 control participants. At the end of the intervention period exercise was seen to be statistically more effective than the control intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.37 to -0.17). Benefits of exercise on fatigue were observed for interventions delivered during or post-adjuvant cancer therapy. In relation to diagnosis, we identified benefits of exercise on fatigue for breast and prostate cancer but not for those with haematological malignancies. Finally, aerobic exercise significantly reduced fatigue but resistance training and alternative forms of exercise failed to reach significance. Authors' conclusions The findings of the updated review have enabled a more precise conclusion to be made in that aerobic exercise can be regarded as beneficial for individuals with cancer-related fatigue during and post-cancer therapy, specifically those with solid tumours. Further research is required to determine the optimal type, intensity and timing of an exercise intervention."
Exercise interventions for cerebral palsy.	"Background: Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from an injury to the developing brain. It is the most common form of childhood disability with prevalence rates of between 1.5 and 3.8 per 1000 births reported worldwide. The primary impairments associated with CP include reduced muscle strength and reduced cardiorespiratory fitness, resulting in difficulties performing activities such as dressing, walking and negotiating stairs. Exercise is defined as a planned, structured and repetitive activity that aims to improve fitness, and it is a commonly used intervention for people with CP. Aerobic and resistance training may improve activity (i.e. the ability to execute a task) and participation (i.e. involvement in a life situation) through their impact on the primary impairments of CP. However, to date, there has been no comprehensive review of exercise interventions for people with CP. Objectives: To assess the effects of exercise interventions in people with CP, primarily in terms of activity, participation and quality of life. Secondary outcomes assessed body functions and body structures. Comparators of interest were no treatment, usual care or an alternative type of exercise intervention. Search methods: In June 2016 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases and four trials registers. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of children, adolescents and adults with CP. We included studies of aerobic exercise, resistance training, and 'mixed training' (a combination of at least two of aerobic exercise, resistance training and anaerobic training). Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and potentially relevant full-text reports for eligibility; extracted all relevant data and conducted 'Risk of bias' and GRADE assessments. Main results: We included 29 trials (926 participants); 27 included children and adolescents up to the age of 19 years, three included adolescents and young adults (10 to 22 years), and one included adults over 20 years. Males constituted 53% of the sample. Five trials were conducted in the USA; four in Australia; two in Egypt, Korea, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, the Netherlands, and the UK; three in Greece; and one apiece in India, Italy, Norway, and South Africa. Twenty-six trials included people with spastic CP only; three trials included children and adolescents with spastic and other types of CP. Twenty-one trials included people who were able to walk with or without assistive devices, four trials also included people who used wheeled mobility devices in most settings, and one trial included people who used wheeled mobility devices only. Three trials did not report the functional ability of participants. Only two trials reported participants' manual ability. Eight studies compared aerobic exercise to usual care, while 15 compared resistance training and 4 compared mixed training to usual care or no treatment. Two trials compared aerobic exercise to resistance training. We judged all trials to be at high risk of bias overall. We found low-quality evidence that aerobic exercise improves gross motor function in the short term (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 1.04, N = 65, 3 studies) and intermediate term (mean difference (MD) 12.96%, 95% CI 0.52% to 25.40%, N = 12, 1 study). Aerobic exercise does not improve gait speed in the short term (MD 0.09 m/s, 95% CI -0.11 m/s to 0.28 m/s, N = 82, 4 studies, very low-quality evidence) or intermediate term (MD -0.17 m/s, 95% CI -0.59 m/s to 0.24 m/s, N = 12, 1 study, low-quality evidence). No trial assessed participation or quality of life following aerobic exercise. We found low-quality evidence that resistance training does not improve gross motor function (SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.43, N = 164, 7 studies), gait speed (MD 0.03 m/s, 95% CI -0.02 m/s to 0.07 m/s, N = 185, 8 studies), participation (SMD 0.34, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.70, N = 127, 2 studies) or parent-reported quality of life (MD 12.70, 95% CI -5.63 to 31.03, n = 12, 1 study) in the short term. There is also low-quality evidence that resistance training does not improve gait speed (MD -0.03 m/s, 95% CI -0.17 m/s to 0.11 m/s, N = 84, 3 studies), gross motor function (SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.55, N = 85, 3 studies) or participation (MD 0.37, 95% CI -6.61 to 7.35, N = 36, 1 study) in the intermediate term. We found low-quality evidence that mixed training does not improve gross motor function (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.33, N = 163, 4 studies) or gait speed (MD 0.10 m/s, -0.07 m/s to 0.27 m/s, N = 58, 1 study) but does improve participation (MD 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.67, N = 65, 1 study) in the short-term. There is no difference between resistance training and aerobic exercise in terms of the effect on gross motor function in the short term (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.55, N = 56, 2 studies, low-quality evidence). Thirteen trials did not report adverse events, seven reported no adverse events, and nine reported non-serious adverse events. Authors' conclusions: The quality of evidence for all conclusions is low to very low. As included trials have small sample sizes, heterogeneity may be underestimated, resulting in considerable uncertainty relating to effect estimates. For children with CP, there is evidence that aerobic exercise may result in a small improvement in gross motor function, though it does not improve gait speed. There is evidence that resistance training does not improve gait speed, gross motor function, participation or quality of life among children with CP. Based on the evidence available, exercise appears to be safe for people with CP; only 55% of trials, however, reported adverse events or stated that they monitored adverse events. There is a need for large, high-quality, well-reported RCTs that assess the effectiveness of exercise in terms of activity and participation, before drawing any firm conclusions on the effectiveness of exercise for people with CP. Research is also required to determine if current exercise guidelines for the general population are effective and feasible for people with CP."
Exercise programs for people with dementia.	"Background This is an update of our previous 2013 review. Several recent trials and systematic reviews of the impact of exercise on people with dementia are reporting promising findings. Objectives Search methods We identified trials for inclusion in the review by searching ALOIS (), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register, on 4 September 2011, on 13 August 2012, and again on 3 October 2013. Selection criteria In this review, we included randomized controlled trials in which older people, diagnosed with dementia, were allocated either to exercise programs or to control groups (usual care or social contact/activities) with the aim of improving cognition, ADLs, neuropsychiatric symptoms, depression, and mortality. Secondary outcomes related to the family caregiver(s) and included caregiver burden, quality of life, mortality, and use of healthcare services. Data collection and analysis Independently, at least two authors assessed the retrieved articles for inclusion, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data. We analysed data for summary effects. We calculated mean differences or standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous data, and synthesized data for each outcome using a fixed-effect model, unless there was substantial heterogeneity between studies, when we used a random-effects model. We planned to explore heterogeneity in relation to severity and type of dementia, and type, frequency, and duration of exercise program. We also evaluated adverse events. Main results Seventeen trials with 1067 participants met the inclusion criteria. However, the required data from three included trials and some of the data from a fourth trial were not published and not made available. The included trials were highly heterogeneous in terms of subtype and severity of participants' dementia, and type, duration, and frequency of exercise. Only two trials included participants living at home. Authors' conclusions There is promising evidence that exercise programs may improve the ability to perform ADLs in people with dementia, although some caution is advised in interpreting these findings. The review revealed no evidence of benefit from exercise on cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, or depression. There was little or no evidence regarding the remaining outcomes of interest (i.e., mortality, caregiver burden, caregiver quality of life, caregiver mortality, and use of healthcare services)."
Exercise rehabilitation following intensive care unit discharge for recovery from critical illness.	"Background Skeletal muscle wasting and weakness are significant complications of critical illness, associated with degree of illness severity and periods of reduced mobility during mechanical ventilation. They contribute to the profound physical and functional deficits observed in survivors. These impairments may persist for many years following discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU) and can markedly influence health-related quality of life. Rehabilitation is a key strategy in the recovery of patients after critical illness. Exercise-based interventions are aimed at targeting this muscle wasting and weakness. Physical rehabilitation delivered during ICU admission has been systematically evaluated and shown to be beneficial. However, its effectiveness when initiated after ICU discharge has yet to be established. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of exercise rehabilitation programmes, initiated after ICU discharge, for functional exercise capacity and health-related quality of life in adult ICU survivors who have been mechanically ventilated longer than 24 hours. Search methods We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid SP MEDLINE, Ovid SP EMBASE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) via EBSCO host to 15 May 2014. We used a specific search strategy for each database. This included synonyms for ICU and critical illness, exercise training and rehabilitation. We searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted primary authors to obtain further information regarding potentially eligible studies. We also searched major clinical trials registries (Clinical Trials and Current Controlled Trials) and the personal libraries of the review authors. We applied no language or publication restriction. We reran the search in February 2015 and will deal with the three studies of interest when we update the review. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that compared an exercise intervention initiated after ICU discharge versus any other intervention or a control or 'usual care' programme in adult (>= 18 years) survivors of critical illness. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. Main results We included six trials (483 adult ICU participants). Exercise-based interventions were delivered on the ward in two studies; both on the ward and in the community in one study; and in the community in three studies. The duration of the intervention varied according to length of hospital stay following ICU discharge (up to a fixed duration of 12 weeks). Authors' conclusions At this time, we are unable to determine an overall effect on functional exercise capacity, or on health-related quality of life, of an exercise-based intervention initiated after ICU discharge for survivors of critical illness. Meta-analysis of findings was not appropriate because the number of studies and the quantity of data were insufficient. Individual study findings were inconsistent. Some studies reported a beneficial effect of the intervention on functional exercise capacity, and others did not. No effect on health-related quality of life was reported. Methodological rigour was lacking across several domains, influencing the quality of the evidence. Wide variability was noted in the characteristics of interventions, outcome measures and associated metrics and data reporting."
Exercise training and cardiac autonomic function in type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review	"Cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is a common complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It has been found to independently predict all cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. It remains unclear whether exercise training could improve autonomic control in T2DM patients. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the effects of exercise training on cardiac autonomic function in T2DM patients. Electronic databases (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PEDro, Scopus and Web of science) were systematically searched to retrieve relevant evidence. Clinical trials administering exercise training for at least 4 weeks and examining either heart rate variability (HRV), baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), heart rate recovery (HRR) as outcome measures were eligible. Eighteen articles were found to be relevant and were then assessed for characteristics and quality. Fifteen studies out of 18 found that exercise training leads to positive improvements in autonomic function of T2DM patients. Exercise participation enhances cardiac autonomic function of type 2 diabetics and therefore should be implemented in their management programs. Copyright ¬© 2017 Diabetes India.

Existential suffering in the palliative care setting: an integrated literature review	"CONTEXT: Existential and spiritual concerns in relation to palliative end-of-life care have received increasing attention over the past decade. OBJECTIVES: To review the literature specifically related to existential suffering in palliative care in terms of the significance of existential suffering in end-of-life care, definitions, conceptual frameworks, and interventions. METHODS: A systematic approach was undertaken with the aim of identifying emerging themes in the literature. Databases using CINAHL (1980-2009), MEDLINE (1970-2009), and PsychINFO (1980-2009) and the search engine of Google Scholar were searched under the key words existential suffering, existential distress, existential pain, palliative and end of life care. RESULTS: The search yielded a total of 156 articles; 32% were peer-reviewed empirical research articles, 28% were peer-reviewed theoretical articles, and 14% were reviews or opinion-based articles. After manually searching bibliographies and related reference lists, 64 articles were considered relevant and are discussed in this review. Overall analysis identifies knowledge of the following: 1) emerging themes related to existential suffering, 2) critical review of those identified themes, 3) current gaps in the research literature, and 4) recommendations for future research. Findings from this comprehensive review reveal that existential suffering and deep personal anguish at the end of life are some of the most debilitating conditions that occur in patients who are dying, and yet the way such suffering is treated in the last days is not well understood. CONCLUSION: Given the broad range of definitions attributed to existential suffering, palliative care clinicians may need to be mindful of their own choices and consider treatment options from a critical perspective."
Expanding the Circle of Knowledge: Reconceptualizing Successful Aging Among North American Older Indigenous Peoples	"Objectives: Indigenous older peoples' voices and experiences remain largely absent in the dominant models and critical scholarship on aging and late life. This article examines the relevance of the model of successful aging for Indigenous peoples in North America. Method: This article presents the results of a review of the published conceptual literature on successful aging among Indigenous peoples. Our intent was to explore the current state of the field of successful aging among Indigenous peoples and suggest dimensions that may be more reflective of Indigenous voices and experiences that leads to a more inclusive model of successful aging. Results: Based on our review, we suggest four dimensions that may broaden understandings of successful aging to be more inclusive of Indigenous older people: health and wellness, empowerment and resilience, engagement and behavior, and connectedness. Discussion: Our review suggests that Indigenous peoples' voices and experiences are beginning to be included in academic literature on successful aging. However, we suggest that understandings of successful aging be broadened based on our summative findings and a process of community involvement. Such processes can lead to the development of models that are more inclusive to a wide range of older people, including Indigenous older peoples."
Expanding the concept of shared decision making for mental health: Systematic search and scoping review of interventions	"Purpose: Much of the existing literature on shared decision making (SDM) in mental health has focused on the use of decision aids (DAs). However, DAs tend to focus on information exchange and neglect other essential elements to SDM in mental health. The purpose of this paper is to expand the review of SDM interventions in mental health by identifying important components, in addition to information exchange, that may contribute to the SDM process in mental health. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a systematic literature search using the Ovid-Medline database with supplementary scoping search of the literature on SDM in mental health treatment. To be eligible for inclusion, studies needed to describe (in a conceptual work or development paper) or evaluate (in any type of research design) a SDM intervention in mental health. The authors included studies of participants with a mental illness facing a mental health care decision, their caregivers, and providers. Findings: A final sample of 31 records was systematically selected. Most interventions were developed and/or piloted in the USA for adults in community psychiatric settings. Although information exchange was a central component of the identified studies, important additional elements were: eliciting patient preferences and values, providing patient communication skills training, eliciting shared care planning, facilitating patient motivation, and eliciting patient participation in goal setting. Originality/value: The review indicates that additional elements, other than information exchange such as sufficient rapport and trusting relationships, are important and needed as part of SDM in mental health. Future SDM interventions in mental health could consider including techniques that aim to increase patient involvement in activities such as goal settings, values, and preference clarification, or facilitating patient motivation, before and after presenting treatment options.

Experiences and Outcomes of Transition from Pediatric to Adult Health Care Services for Young People with Congenital Heart Disease: A Systematic Review	"This review synthesizes the empirical literature on outcomes and experiences of transfer and transition from pediatric to adult care for young people with congenital heart disease. A systematic review of papers published between January 2001 and May 2013 that examined outcomes or experiences of transfer and transition among young people with congenital heart disease was conducted. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers with the outcomes data combined using narrative synthesis and the experiences data integrated using thematic synthesis. Thirteen papers were included in the review: six reported outcomes following transfer, six reported experiences of transfer and transition, and one reported both outcomes and experiences. The review data indicate that high proportions of young people were lost to follow-up or experienced long gaps in care after leaving pediatric cardiology. Factors that protected against loss to follow-up or lapse in care included: beliefs that specialized adult care was necessary; poorer health status; attendance at pediatric appointments without parents; and pediatric referral to an adult congenital heart disease center. Data on experiences highlighted that many young people were unconcerned about transition, but lacked knowledge about their condition and were insufficiently prepared for transfer. In terms of adult services, many young people desired continuity in the quality of care, youth-oriented facilities, a personalized approach, and for their parents to remain involved in their care, but in a secondary, supportive capacity. In conclusion, the high proportions of young people lost to follow-up highlight the need for formal transition programs, which ensure a planned and coordinated transfer. Patients with congenital heart disease need education throughout adolescence about the implications of their condition, the differences between pediatric and adult services, and self-care management.

Experiences of cancer patients in a patient navigation program: a qualitative systematic review	"BACKGROUND: A patient navigation program is a model of care which entails trained personnel providing individualized and assistive care to adult oncology patients to help the patients overcome barriers. A further aim of the program is to achieve continuity of care as patients experience the complex healthcare system. Patient navigation is a new model of care in many institutions, and as such the experiences of patients in the patient navigation program remains inconclusive. OBJECTIVES: The review seeks to understand the experiences of adult patients in patient navigation programs and how patient navigators impact the challenges patients encounter in the cancer care continuum. INCLUSION CRITERIA: TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Participants of interest were adult cancer patients more than 18 years of age who are receiving or have received cancer care and are in a patient navigation program or had been in a hospital patient navigation program. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest: The phenomenon of interest was the experiences of adult cancer patients who used patient navigation programs in hospital including how patient navigators impact on the challenges patients encounter in the cancer care continuum. Types of studies: This review considered studies that focused on qualitative data including, but not limited to, designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, action research and exploratory studies. CONTEXT: The review includes patient navigation programs within a hospital setting. Types of outcome: The review sought to understand the experiences of patients with cancer in patient navigation programs in the hospital. SEARCH STRATEGY: A three-step search strategy was used. An initial search to identify keywords was undertaken in PubMed and Science Direct followed by an expanded search using all identified keywords and index terms specific to each included database. The reference lists of included papers were then searched for any other relevant studies. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Each paper was assessed independently by two reviewers for methodological quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. Any disagreements that arose between the reviewers were resolved through discussion. DATA COLLECTION: Data extraction and synthesis was conducted using standardized data extraction and synthesis tools from JBI-QARI. DATA SYNTHESIS: The 17 unequivocal and credible findings of included studies were categorized according to similarity of meaning and developed into three synthesized findings. RESULTS: Three papers were included in the review. The three synthesized findings from the 17 findings extracted from the papers were: (1) Emotional empowerment: patient navigators need to be present with patients at key phases of the cancer care continuum and assure patients of their accessibility; (2) Knowledge empowerment: patient navigators need to explore and manage the needs and expectations of patients so that the healthcare team and patient have the same understanding of treatment goals and plans; and (3) Bridging the gaps: patient navigators need to ensure practical assistance is provided for patients to ensure continuity of care even at the completion of the treatment regimen. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a patient navigator provides strong support to the patients when experiencing disruption from cancer diagnosis and treatment. The emotional isolation they experience lessens with the assurance that there is always a consistent and constant contact point they can fall back on. The logistic and practical help given by the navigators allows patients to take time to process information and make sense of what is happening. Copyright The Joanna Briggs Institute."
Experiences of in-patient mental health services: systematic review.	"BACKGROUND: In-patients in crisis report poor experiences of mental healthcare not conducive to recovery. Concerns include coercion by staff, fear of assault from other patients, lack of therapeutic opportunities and limited support. There is little high-quality evidence on what is important to patients to inform recovery-focused care.AimsTo conduct a systematic review of published literature, identifying key themes for improving experiences of in-patient mental healthcare. METHOD: A systematic search of online databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL) for primary research published between January 2000 and January 2016. All study designs from all countries were eligible. A qualitative analysis was undertaken and study quality was appraised. A patient and public reference group contributed to the review. RESULTS: Studies (72) from 16 countries found four dimensions were consistently related to significantly influencing in-patients' experiences of crisis and recovery-focused care: the importance of high-quality relationships; averting negative experiences of coercion; a healthy, safe and enabling physical and social environment; and authentic experiences of patient-centred care. Critical elements for patients were trust, respect, safe wards, information and explanation about clinical decisions, therapeutic activities, and family inclusion in care. CONCLUSIONS: A number of experiences hinder recovery-focused care and must be addressed with the involvement of staff to provide high-quality in-patient services. Future evaluations of service quality and development of practice guidance should embed these four dimensions.Declaration of interestK.B. is editor of British Journal of Psychiatry and leads a national programme (Synergi Collaborative Centre) on patient experiences driving change in services and inequalities."
Experiences of living with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: A systematic review and synthesis of qualitative data	"Aim: To identify and assess available evidence from qualitative studies exploring experiences of individuals living with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) or those living with a child with FASD, as well as experiences of interventions aimed at supporting individuals with FASD and their families. Method: A systematic literature search was conducted in six electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Scopus. Included studies were analysed using manifest content analysis. Methodological limitations and confidence in the evidence were assessed using a modified version of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and EvaluationÄìConfidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research approach respectively. Results: Findings from 18 studies show that individuals with FASD experience a variation of disabilities, ranging from somatic problems, high pain tolerance, destructive behaviour, hyperactivity, and aggressiveness, to social problems with friendship, school attendance, and maintenance of steady employment. Most studies reported parents"" experiences with FASD; parenting was viewed as a lifelong engagement and that the whole family is isolated and burdened because of FASD. People with FASD feel that their difficulties affect their daily life in a limiting way and make them feel different from others. Interpretation: From the perspective of primarily parents, individuals with FASD and their parents face many different difficulties, for which they need societal support. What this paper adds Individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) feel their difficulties make them different from others. Parents think of their parenting as a lifelong engagement. There is a shortage of studies investigating experiences of children with FASD. There is a shortage of studies investigating experiences of interventions given to individuals with FASD.

Experiences of Reframing during Self-Directed Weight Loss and Weight Loss Maintenance: Systematic Review of Qualitative Studies.	"BACKGROUND: Reframing means changing the way that a person thinks or feels about a weight loss attempt or weight loss maintenance to enhance its experience or facilitate its success. Although participants have described this, it has not been explored in the academic literature. Here, we set out to systematically review qualitative studies to examine the ways in which people use and experience reframing in self-directed weight loss. METHODS: Seven electronic databases were searched to January 2017 for qualitative studies of adults with overweight or obesity attempting to lose weight or maintain weight loss through self-directed behavior change. Studies must have contained some information pertinent to reframing. Thematic synthesis was used to identify descriptive and analytical themes from the available data. RESULTS: We included 23 studies, representing 723 participants. No study focused specifically on reframing. Most studies involved people who had tried to lose weight previously. In the most common examples of reframing, participants spoke of construing previous weight management attempts as ""dieting"", whereas in current attempts they used reframing to move away from this concept. Participants spoke of finding reframing helpful because it removed the sense of depriving themselves and instead allowed them to construe the food choices as healthful. Likewise, the language of dieting created a sense of temporary effort, while construing this as a way of life allowed continuation of conscious control over energy balance without the feeling of undue effort. In some cases, these changes were bolstered by change in self-identity. CONCLUSIONS: Some people construe deliberate weight loss as a form of deprivation and cognitively reframe to avoid the negative emotions this creates and to prevent relapse. Reframing the dietary regimen as about healthy eating and a new way of life made weight control seem less burdensome for these participants and they felt able to maintain their efforts.

Exploring the nature of interprofessional collaboration and family member involvement in an intensive care context.	"Little is known about the nature of interprofessional collaboration on intensive care units (ICUs), despite its recognition as a key component of patient safety and quality improvement initiatives. This comparative ethnographic study addresses this gap in knowledge and explores the different factors that influence collaborative work in the ICU. It aims to develop an empirically grounded team diagnostic tool, and associated interventions to strengthen team-based care and patient family involvement. This iterative study is comprised of three phases: a scoping review, a multi-site ethnographic study in eight ICUs over 2 years; and the development of a diagnostic tool and associated interprofessional intervention-development. This study's multi-site design and the richness and breadth of its data maximize its potential to improve clinical outcomes through an enhanced understanding of interprofessional dynamics and how patient family members in ICU settings are best included in care processes. Our research dissemination strategy, as well as the diagnostic tool and associated educational interventions developed from this study will help transfer the study's findings to other settings."
Exploring the psychological benefits and challenges experienced by peer-helpers participating in take-home naloxone programmes: A rapid review	"Overdose is a significant problem in many countries around the world and is the leading cause of death among people who use drugs (PWUD). In order to avoid death caused by an overdose, it is necessary to intervene rapidly. Since PWUD often consume together, they are in an optimal position placed to intervene in emergency situations. Some opioid overdose prevention programmes have trained PWUD to intervene by administering naloxone. Little research has been devoted to understanding the benefits associated with the peer-helper role in the context of these programmes. Aim: This rapid review aims to summarise research on the personal impacts of the peer-helper role in overdose prevention programmes, based on peer-helper literature and general findings from peer research from other domains, including mental health and HIV/AIDS programmes. Method: The review includes a search for articles on peer-helpers from PsychInfo, PsychNET, PubMed, PsycARTICLES, Medline, Web of Science, McGill University Library WorldCat network, Scopus, and google scholar. Results: The search generated a total of 152 articles, 27 of which are discussed in detail. Findings: While many articles have been published on the impact of peer-helpers being involved in an intervention, only a few articles have been published on the psychological impacts of being a peer-helper in overdose prevention programmes. Exploratory studies suggest that empowerment and recovery are important benefits. Conditions to optimise these benefits are identified, and are relevant to programme and policy-makers."
Exploring the role of community engagement in improving the health of disadvantaged populations: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Although community engagement (CE) is widely used in health promotion, components of CE models associated with improved health are poorly understood. This study aimed to examine the magnitude of the impact of CE on health and health inequalities among disadvantaged populations, which methodological approaches maximise the effectiveness of CE, and components of CE that are acceptable, feasible, and effective when used among disadvantaged populations. DESIGN: The systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We carried out methodological assessments of the included studies using rating scales. The analysis focussed on model synthesis to identify the key CE components linked to positive study outcomes and comparative analysis between positive study outcomes, processes, and quality indicators of CE. RESULTS: Out of 24 studies that met our inclusion criteria, 21 (87.5%) had positively impacted health behaviours, public health planning, health service access, health literacy, and a range of health outcomes. More than half of the studies (58%) were of good quality, whereas 71% and 42% of studies showed good community involvement in research and achieved high levels of CE, respectively. Key CE components that affected health outcomes included real power-sharing, collaborative partnerships, bidirectional learning, incorporating the voice and agency of beneficiary communities in research protocol, and using bicultural health workers for intervention delivery. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that CE models can lead to improved health and health behaviours among disadvantaged populations if designed properly and implemented through effective community consultation and participation. We also found several gaps in the current measurement of CE in health intervention studies, which suggests the importance of developing innovative approaches to measure CE impact on health outcomes in a more rigorous way."
Expressive writing interventions in cancer patients: a systematic review	"Decades of research have suggested that expressive writing produces physical and psychological benefits in controlled laboratory experiments among healthy college students. This work has been extended to clinical and medical populations, including cancer patients. Although expressive writing could be a promising and inexpensive intervention for this population, the effects have not been systematically examined in oncology samples. A systematic review using PRISMA guidelines was conducted for experimental trials of cancer patients who participated in an expressive writing intervention. PsycINFO and PubMed/Medline were searched for peer-reviewed studies. Thirteen articles met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Although the majority of the intervention effects were null, there were several main effects for expressive writing on sleep, pain, and general physical and psychological symptoms. Several moderators were identified, suggesting that expressive writing may be more or less beneficial based on individual characteristics such as social constraints. The reviewed studies were limited due to representativeness of the samples, performance, detection and patient-reported outcomes biases, and heterogeneity of the intervention protocol and writing prompts. Future studies with rigorous designs are needed to determine whether expressive writing is therapeutically effective in cancer patients."
Extent and Predictors of Decision Regret about Health Care Decisions: A Systematic Review	"BACKGROUND: People often face difficult decisions about their health and may later regret the choice that they made. However, little is known about the extent of decision regret in health care or its predictors. We systematically reviewed evidence about the extent of decision regret and its risk factors among individuals making health decisions. METHODS: The data sources were Medline, Embase, and reverse citation searches in Google Scholar and Web of Science. Studies using the Decision Regret Scale (DRS) to measure decision regret among individuals making nonhypothetical health decisions were included. There were no restrictions on study design, setting, or language. We extracted characteristics of included studies, measures of central tendency for DRS scores (0 = no regret, 100 = high regret), and all risk factors from published analyses. Quality appraisal was conducted using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. A narrative synthesis was performed owing to the heterogeneity of studies. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 372 unique titles, and 59 studies were included. The overall mean DRS score across studies was 16.5, and the median of the mean scores was 14.3 (standard deviation range = 2.2-34.5) (n = 44 studies). The risk factors most frequently reported to be associated with decision regret in multivariate analyses included higher decisional conflict, lower satisfaction with the decision, adverse physical health outcomes, and greater anxiety levels. CONCLUSIONS: The extent of decision regret as assessed with the DRS in nonhypothetical health decisions was often low but reached high levels for some decisions. Several risk factors related to the decision-making process significantly predicted decision regret. Additional research into the psychometrics of the DRS and the relevance of scores for clinicians and patients would increase the validity of decision regret as a patient-reported outcome.

Face-to-face interventions for informing or educating parents about early childhood vaccination.	"Background Early childhood vaccination is an essential global public health practice that saves two to three million lives each year, but many children do not receive all the recommended vaccines. To achieve and maintain appropriate coverage rates, vaccination programmes rely on people having sufficient awareness and acceptance of vaccines. Objectives To assess the effects of face-to-face interventions for informing or educating parents about early childhood vaccination on vaccination status and parental knowledge, attitudes and intention to vaccinate. Search methods We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, and two trial registries (July and August 2017). We screened reference lists of relevant articles, and contacted authors of included studies and experts in the field. We had no language or date restrictions. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs evaluating the effects of face-to-face interventions delivered to parents or expectant parents to inform or educate them about early childhood vaccination, compared with control or with another face-to-face intervention. The World Health Organization recommends that children receive all early childhood vaccines, with the exception of human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV), which is delivered to adolescents. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently reviewed all search results, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Main results In this update, we found four new studies, for a total of ten studies. We included seven RCTs and three cluster-RCTs involving a total of 4527 participants, although we were unable to pool the data from one cluster-RCT. Three of the ten studies were conducted in low- or middle- income countries. Authors' conclusions There is low- to moderate-certainty evidence suggesting that face-to-face information or education may improve or slightly improve children's vaccination status, parents' knowledge, and parents' intention to vaccinate."
Facial emotion recognition accuracy and child physical abuse: An experiment and a meta-analysis	"Objective: To examine child facial emotion recognition accuracy (ERA) in high-risk for child physical abuse (CPA) parents and low-risk for CPA parents (Study 1) and to conduct a meta-analysis summarizing published research on the relationship between child facial ERA and CPA (Study 2). Method: In Study 1, ERA data for child facial emotions were obtained from mothers and fathers who were at high risk (n = 51) or low risk (n = 61) for CPA. In 1 of 2 presentation time conditions (100 ms, 600 ms), parents evaluated child photographs, taken from the Radboud Faces Database, which displayed 5 face emotions (angry, happy, sad, fearful, neutral) at 3 face angles (frontal, 45 degrees, 90 degrees). In Study 2, a meta-analysis of published studies was used to estimate the overall effect size of ERA differences between high-risk/abusive and comparison parents. Results: In Study 1, ERA differences were found for emotions (largest ERA for happiness), face angles (frontal > 45 degrees > 90 degrees), and presentation times (100 ms < 600 ms); however, only an overall trend for ERA risk group differences was observed. Nevertheless, the Study 2 meta-analyses revealed a significant effect size reflecting an overall moderate ERA difference between high-risk/abusive and comparison parents, and the effect size was not moderated by the population studied (high-risk parents vs. abusive parents). Conclusions: Because child facial ERA appears to be associated with CPA, the manner in which parental child emotion recognition errors contribute to problematic parentÄìchild interactions merits additional study.

Facilitated parent-child groups as family support: A systematic literature review of supported playgroup studies	"Supported playgroups are community-based services that provide low intensity family support, through regular group sessions for parents and their young children. Led by a playgroup facilitator, the program aims to enrich children""s early learning, enhance positive parenting behaviors, provide social connections for parents, and enable access to other community services. Despite high community acceptance and government investment, little is known about the extent to which such services are effective. This paper reports findings from a systematic review of research on supported playgroups and their effectiveness to improve child, parent, and community outcomes. Thirty-four studies were included, of which 28 were conducted in Australia. Programs targeted a diverse range of families who were considered socially disadvantaged. Seven studies employed experimental or quasi-experimental designs from which reliable evidence for effectiveness could be established. A high proportion of studies were qualitative and included action research, case studies, or ethnographies. A range of qualitative and quantitative measures were used to assess child, parent, and community outcomes. While findings suggested that supported playgroup programs were highly valued by parents and other stakeholders, rigorous evidence of effectiveness for achieving desired improvements in child outcomes or parenting behavior was rare and limited by low quality study designs. More explicit theories of change about how different types of supported playgroup programs can meet diverse family needs are required. Such theories of change would provide directions for specific content and delivery approaches that could address and improve different child and parent outcomes targeted to specific populations of attending families.

Facilitators and barriers of implementing and delivering social prescribing services: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Social Prescribing is a service in primary care that involves the referral of patients with non-clinical needs to local services and activities provided by the third sector (community, voluntary, and social enterprise sector). Social Prescribing aims to promote partnership working between the health and the social sector to address the wider determinants of health. To date, there is a weak evidence base for Social Prescribing services. The objective of the review was to identify factors that facilitate and hinder the implementation and delivery of SP services based in general practice involving a navigator. METHODS: We searched eleven databases, the grey literature, and the reference lists of relevant studies to identify the barriers and facilitators to the implementation and delivery of Social Prescribing services in June and July 2016. Searches were limited to literature written in English. No date restrictions were applied. Findings were synthesised narratively, employing thematic analysis. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool Version 2011 was used to evaluate the methodological quality of included studies. RESULTS: Eight studies were included in the review. The synthesis identified a range of factors that facilitate and hinder the implementation and delivery of SP services. Facilitators and barriers were related to: the implementation approach, legal agreements, leadership, management and organisation, staff turnover, staff engagement, relationships and communication between partners and stakeholders, characteristics of general practices, and the local infrastructure. The quality of most included studies was poor and the review identified a lack of published literature on factors that facilitate and hinder the implementation and delivery of Social Prescribing services. CONCLUSION: The review identified a range of factors that facilitate and hinder the implementation and delivery of Social Prescribing services. Findings of this review provide an insight for commissioners, managers, and providers to guide the implementation and delivery of future Social Prescribing services. More high quality research and transparent reporting of findings is needed in this field."
Facilitators and Barriers to Person-centred Care in Child and Young People Mental Health Services: A Systematic Review	"Implementation of person-centred care has been widely advocated across various health settings and patient populations, including recent policy for child and family services. Nonetheless, evidence suggests that service users are rarely involved in decision-making, whilst their preferences and goals may be often unheard. The aim of the present research was to systematically review factors influencing person-centred care in mental health services for children, young people and families examining perspectives from professionals, service users and carers. This was conducted according to best practice guidelines, and seven academic databases were searched. Overall, 23 qualitative studies were included. Findings from the narrative synthesis of the facilitators and barriers are discussed in light of a recently published systematic review examining person-centred care in mental health services for adults. Facilitators and barriers were broadly similar across both settings. Training professionals in person-centred care, supporting them to use it flexibly to meet the unique needs of service users whilst also being responsive to times when it may be less appropriate and improving both the quantity and quality of information for service users and carers are key recommendations to facilitate person-centred care in mental health services with children, young people and families. Copyright ¬© 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. KEY PRACTITIONERS MESSAGES: As research shows, children and young people are rarely actively involved in their treatment within mental health services. This is despite a strong recent emphasis on providing care within child and young people mental health services according to person-centred principles. Still, there is little known about factors affecting provision of person-centred care with this population. As found by the current study, the most commonly reported factors affecting provision of person-centred care were information sharing (in an appropriate amount and at a right time), listening, respecting and validating, quality of relationship and support, capacity of children and young people to be involved in their care, parental involvement and shortage of resources. These factors were cited as both facilitators and barriers and were found to be universally important by service users, their carers and professional working at the services. The key factors were broadly similar to those reported among adults, particularly regarding information sharing/communication, capacity of service users to be involved and available resources. The main difference was related to a more complex role of a carer in children/young people services. The key recommendations of the review to improve provision of person-centred care are providing professionals with more training in using the approach, supporting them to use it flexibly to meet the unique needs of service users whilst also being responsive to times when it may be less appropriate and improving both the quantity and quality of information for service users.

Factors Associated With Higher Caregiver Burden Among Family Caregivers of Elderly Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review	"BACKGROUND: Caring for elderly cancer patients may cause multidimensional burden on family caregivers. Recognition of factors associated with caregiver burden is important for providing proactive support to caregivers at risk. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with high caregiver burden among family caregivers of elderly cancer patients. METHODS: A systematic search of 7 electronic databases was conducted from database inception to October 2014. The identified studies were screened, and full text was further assessed. The quality of included studies was assessed using a checklist, and relevant data were extracted using a predeveloped data extraction form. Best-evidence synthesis model was used for data synthesis. RESULTS: The search yielded a total of 3339 studies, and 7 studies involving 1233 family caregivers were included after screening and full assessment of 116 studies. Moderate evidence supported that younger caregivers, solid tumors, and assistance with patient's activities of daily living were significantly associated with high caregiver burden. Eighteen factors were supported by limited evidence, and 1 was a conflicting factor. CONCLUSIONS: The scientific literature to date proved that caregiver burden was commonly experienced by family caregivers of elderly cancer patients. The evidence indicated that family caregivers who were at younger age, caring for solid tumor patients, and providing assistance with patient's activities of daily living reported high caregiver burden. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The data provide evidence in identifying family caregivers at high risk of high caregiver burden. More high-quality studies are needed to clarify and determine the estimates of the effects of individual factors."
Factors Associated With Participation in Life Situations for Adults With Stroke: A Systematic Review	"OBJECTIVES: To identify biopsychosocial factors associated with participation outcomes for adults with stroke and to investigate factors associated with participation at different time points poststroke. DATA SOURCES: Medline, CINAHL, AMED, PyschINFO, and Web of Science were systematically searched using keywords stroke, participation, and outcomes and their synonyms on May 15, 2017. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies reporting on biopsychosocial factors and participation outcomes for community-dwelling adults with stroke were selected. Studies were eligible for inclusion if participation outcomes were measured using indices that mapped to the participation domain of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Intervention studies were excluded. A second reviewer checked all studies against eligibility criteria at each stage. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted on any statistically determined association between biopsychosocial factors and participation outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS: The proportion of studies reporting significant associations with variables was classified according to the ICF. The exact binomial test was used to determine the probability that the proportion of studies reporting significant associations was due to chance alone. Qualitative descriptive summaries of each study allowed consideration of interactions between variables and changes in participation over time points. CONCLUSIONS: Although depressive symptoms, cognitive functioning, and mobility were found to have the strongest associations with participation, we found that other frequently occurring factors (such as fatigue and environmental factors) were less extensively considered. The diversity of outcome measures encountered within the review highlight the need for a consensus on a core set of outcome measures to evaluate long-term participation in life situations poststroke.

Factors influencing acceptance of technology for aging in place: a systematic review	"PURPOSE: To provide an overview of factors influencing the acceptance of electronic technologies that support aging in place by community-dwelling older adults. Since technology acceptance factors fluctuate over time, a distinction was made between factors in the pre-implementation stage and factors in the post-implementation stage. METHODS: A systematic review of mixed studies. Seven major scientific databases (including MEDLINE, Scopus and CINAHL) were searched. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) original and peer-reviewed research, (2) qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods research, (3) research in which participants are community-dwelling older adults aged 60 years or older, and (4) research aimed at investigating factors that influence the intention to use or the actual use of electronic technology for aging in place. Three researchers each read the articles and extracted factors. RESULTS: Sixteen out of 2841 articles were included. Most articles investigated acceptance of technology that enhances safety or provides social interaction. The majority of data was based on qualitative research investigating factors in the pre-implementation stage. Acceptance in this stage is influenced by 27 factors, divided into six themes: concerns regarding technology (e.g., high cost, privacy implications and usability factors); expected benefits of technology (e.g., increased safety and perceived usefulness); need for technology (e.g., perceived need and subjective health status); alternatives to technology (e.g., help by family or spouse), social influence (e.g., influence of family, friends and professional caregivers); and characteristics of older adults (e.g., desire to age in place). When comparing these results to qualitative results on post-implementation acceptance, our analysis showed that some factors are persistent while new factors also emerge. Quantitative results showed that a small number of variables have a significant influence in the pre-implementation stage. Fourteen out of the sixteen included articles did not use an existing technology acceptance framework or model. CONCLUSIONS: Acceptance of technology in the pre-implementation stage is influenced by multiple factors. However, post-implementation research on technology acceptance by community-dwelling older adults is scarce and most of the factors in this review have not been tested by using quantitative methods. Further research is needed to determine if and how the factors in this review are interrelated, and how they relate to existing models of technology acceptance. Copyright ¬© 2014 The Authors.

Factors related to emotional responses in school-aged children who have asthma	"A systematic review of the literature was performed to answer the following questions (a) What factors contribute to the emotional responses of school-age children who have asthma? (b) What are the potential gaps in the literature regarding the emotional responses of school-age children (ages 6-12) who have asthma? (c) Are children with a lower socioeconomic status (SES) and those who are minorities represented in the literature proportionate to their prevalence? Two main focus areas regarding emotional responses were identified: (a) factors related to children who have asthma and (b) factors related to caregivers of children who have asthma. Internalizing disorders were reported consistently for children and caregivers of children who have asthma. Negative consequences of asthma for children included panic and asthma attacks, missed school days, and behavioral problems. Issues for caregivers included higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, asthma management deficits, and lower caregiver warmth and involvement. Gaps in the literature included separated studies for children ages 6-12, a lack of a standardized method to define SES, studies that were of a more experimental nature, and a disparate number of studies of minority children and caregivers relative to their asthma prevalence."
"Families, nurses and organisations contributing factors to medication administration error in paediatrics: a literature review"	"Background: Medication error is the most common adverse event for hospitalised children and can lead to significant harm. Despite decades of research and implementation of a number of initiatives, the error rates continue to rise, particularly those associated with administration. Objectives: The objective of this literature review is to explore the factors involving nurses, families and healthcare systems that impact on medication administration errors in paediatric patients. Design: A review was undertaken of studies that reported on factors that contribute to a rise or fall in medication administration errors, from family, nurse and organisational perspectives. The following databases were searched: Medline, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane library. The title, abstract and full article were reviewed for relevance. Articles were excluded if they were not research studies, they related to medications and not medication administration errors or they referred to medical errors rather than medication errors. Results: A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. The factors contributing to medication administration errors are communication failure between the parents and healthcare professionals, nurse workload, failure to adhere to policy and guidelines, interruptions, inexperience and insufficient nurse education from organisations. Strategies that were reported to reduce errors were double checking by two nurses, implementing educational sessions, use of computerised prescribing and barcoding administration systems. Yet despite such interventions, errors persist. The review highlighted families that have a central role in caring for the child and therefore are key to the administration process, but have largely been ignored in research studies relating to medication administration. Conclusions: While there is a consensus about the factors that contribute to errors, sustainable and effective solutions remain elusive. To date, families have not been included as key stakeholders in researching or developing effective interventions to reduce medication administration errors. Implications for practice: Àù Future solutions to reduce medication errors need to take into account staffing levels, skill-mix, stress and workload. Àù Organisations need to provide appropriate policies and guidelines as well as access to supportive technology and ongoing educational support aimed at reducing errors. Àù Engaging nurses, doctors, pharmacists and, most importantly, families in developing practice through person-centred approaches is vital in order to improve the culture of medication safety and reduce medication errors."
Families' experiences of involvement in care planning in mental health services: an integrative literature review	"Accessible summary What is known on the subject? Current policy advocates for the participation of family carers in care planning., Caring for a person with a mental illness requires a significant commitment from families to support their relative's recovery., What this paper adds to existing knowledge? The evidence of family involvement in care planning is generally fraught with conflicting experiences related to different requirements between mental health professionals, families and service users., Confidentiality remains contentious at a practice level in terms of information sharing and decision-making., There is a requirement and need for a shared understanding around care planning between families and mental health professionals., What are the implications for practice? The provision of written information pertaining to families regarding confidentiality is required at service level., Educational workshops concerning care planning and treatment options should be provided for service users, families and mental health professionals., Further research into effective service-wide strategies that explore with families how their engagement can be positively fostered in mental health services is warranted., Abstract Introduction Mental health service policy stipulates that family carers be involved in care planning. Aim To identify families' experiences of care planning involvement in adult mental health services. Method An integrative review where electronic databases and grey literature were searched for papers published between 01 January 2005 and 10 February 2016. Results Fifteen papers met the inclusion criteria. Thematic analysis generated three themes: (1) families' experience of collaboration, (2) families' perceptions of professionals and (3) families' impressions of the care planning process. Collaborative decision-making is not regularly experienced by families with an 'us' and 'them' divide, perpetuated by a lack of communication, confidentiality constraints and a claim of 'insider knowledge' of service users. When involved, families perceive care planning to be uncoordinated and that their lived experiences are not always appreciated. Discussion Families need to be valued, empowered and engaged in care planning and the partnership distance be addressed. Accommodating the views of family, service user and professionals is preferable but not always possible. Our findings suggest that the key element for professionals is to value all 'insider knowledge' where possible. Implications for Practice Services should develop written information on confidentiality for families and facilitate open communication concerning their involvement in care planning."
Families' experiences of living with pediatric epilepsy: A qualitative systematic review	"Living with epilepsy in childhood has implications for the child and their family beyond the physical effects associated with epileptic seizures. Qualitative research has emerged, aiming to deliver a greater depth of understanding of the experiences of living with epilepsy from the perspectives of children with epilepsy, their parents, and their siblings. This review of qualitative research had three aims: first, to synthesize the demographic and epilepsy profiles of research participants in eligible studies in order to provide a clear picture of who are included and excluded when studying families' experiences; second, to present and discuss the methodological concerns and implications of research involving children with epilepsy; and third, to synthesize the findings arising from qualitative research with families in order to identify common themes across all relevant studies to date. Papers published in the English language prior to January 2016 were identified following a search of eight electronic databases: Embase, Psychinfo, Medline, CINAHL, Web of Knowledge, ASSIA, Web of Science, and SCOPUS. Studies were included if they involved a sample of children with epilepsy (up to 18 years of age), parents, or siblings of children with epilepsy and used qualitative methods. Twenty-one studies were identified as eligible for inclusion in the review. Findings in relation to the three aims were the following: 1) Researchers were seeking an understanding of children's experiences directly from children rather than by parental proxy. However, children with learning disabilities were often excluded from research, meaning that their views are not being heard. Parental research was predominantly with mothers, and father experiences were not often accessed. There was very little research with siblings. 2) The rationale for and ethical implications of the choice of research methods adopted were not always clear, and not all studies gave adequate attention to the development of appropriate methods for research involving children. 3) Two dominant themes emerged across the studies: normalcy and children's agency. Cutting across many of the challenges that living with epilepsy presented was the desire (by parents and children) for a Äònormal"" childhood. The studies also highlighted that children have knowledge about their own condition and epilepsy more generally and that they are involved in managing the ways in which they cope with epilepsy, both in terms of seizure prevention and managing their relations with others, particularly peers. Future research should ensure that appropriate design, data collection, and analytic strategies are adopted to facilitate the participation of all family members. Enhancing the quality of the research will, in turn, optimize validity and opportunities for the translation of findings into better health, education, and social practices to improve care for children and their families affected by epilepsy.

Family factors associated with participation of children with disabilities: a systematic review	"AIM: The aim of this review was to synthesize empirical evidence of family factors associated with participation of children with disabilities aged 5 to 12 years to inform the development of family-centred participation-fostering interventions. METHOD: A systematic search was performed for articles published in English between 2001 and 2017 in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, and ASSIA following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Quality of evidence was appraised using the Research Triangle Institute Item Bank. Family factors associated with participation were identified and assessed using a multistage 'semi-quantitative' approach. RESULTS: Thirty studies were included in the review. Four non-modifiable 'status' factors consistently associated with participation were parental ethnicity, parental education, family type, and family socio-economic status. Six modifiable 'process' factors with consistent associations with participation were parental mental and physical health functioning, parental self-efficacy beliefs, parental support, parental time, family preferences, and activity orientation. INTERPRETATION: Rehabilitation professionals should direct their focus towards modifiable family factors as primary targets for family-centred interventions. Strategies that can improve families' access to information, counselling, and community support services are likely to support children's participation by empowering families and optimizing their health and well-being. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Non-modifiable 'status' and modifiable 'process' factors are important in participation of children with disabilities. Disadvantaged family circumstances shaped by status factors are associated with reduced participation. Key process factors for intervention are parental mental and physical health and parental self-efficacy beliefs. Other important process factors for intervention are parental support and time, family preferences, and activity orientation. Copyright ¬© 2018 The Authors.

Family involvement in managing medications of older patients across transitions of care: a systematic review.	"BACKGROUND: As older patients' health care needs become more complex, they often experience challenges with managing medications across transitions of care. Families play a major role in older patients' lives. To date, there has been no review of the role of families in older people's medication management at transitions of care. This systematic review aimed to examine family involvement in managing older patients' medications across transitions of care. METHODS: Five databases were searched for quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods empirical studies involving families of patients aged 65 years and older: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Complete, Medline, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and EMBASE. All authors participated independently in conducting data selection, extraction and quality assessment using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. A descriptive synthesis and thematic analysis were undertaken of included papers. RESULTS: Twenty-three papers were included, comprising 17 qualitative studies, 5 quantitative studies and one mixed methods study. Families participated in information giving and receiving, decision making, managing medication complexity, and supportive interventions in regard to managing medications for older patients across transitions of care. However, health professionals tended not to acknowledge the medication activities performed by families. While families actively engaged with older patients in strategies to ensure safe medication management, communication about medication plans of care across transitions tended to be haphazard and disorganised, and there was a lack of shared decision making between families and health professionals. In managing medication complexity across transitions of care, family members perceived a lack of tailoring of medication plans for patients' needs, and believed they had to display perseverance to have their views heard by health professionals. CONCLUSIONS: Greater efforts are needed by health professionals in strengthening involvement of families in medication management at transitions of care, through designated family meetings, clinical bedside handovers, ward rounds, and admission and discharge consultations. Future work is needed on evaluating targeted strategies relating to family members' contribution to managing medications at transitions of care, with outcomes directed on family understanding of medication changes and their input in preventing and identifying medication-related problems."
Family to family support programs for the caregivers of schizophrenia patients: a systematic review	"AIM: This systematic review aims to analyze the family to family support programs provided for the families of the schizophrenic patients and there potential impact on caregivers. METHOD: The family to family support programs described by articles in Pubmed, Ovid, Cinahl, Wiley Interscience and Cochrane databases were reviewed. The database research was conducted in English using 5 keywords. Twelve studies were identified using this approach and are included in this review. FINDINGS: The caregivers who participated in the family to family support programs reported a significant decrease in their burden and increase in social support and family function. Moreover, it was noted that there was an increase in life satisfaction and a decrease in the need for education of the caregivers who participated in the programs. RESULTS: All studies included in this review agreed that family to family support programs for the caregivers of schizophrenia patients had positive outcomes. Additionally, these studies suggested that systematic, planned and sustainable educational programs be developed for the caregivers of schizophrenic patients in order to help the caregivers cope with the challenges they encounter during the treatment procedures."
Family- and school-based correlates of energy balance-related behaviours in 10-12-year-old children: a systematic review within the ENERGY (EuropeaN Energy balance Research to prevent excessive weight Gain among Youth) project	"OBJECTIVE: To identify family- and school-based correlates of specific energy balance-related behaviours (physical activity, sedentary behaviour, breakfast consumption, soft drink consumption) among 10-12-year-olds, using the EnRG framework (Environmental Research framework for weight Gain prevention). DESIGN: A literature review to identify observational studies exploring at least one family- or school-based correlate of the specific behaviours, resulting in seventy-six articles. SETTING: Eighteen studies were conducted in Europe, forty-one studies in North America and seventeen studies in Australasia. SUBJECTS: Healthy children aged 10-12 years. RESULTS: Parental and maternal physical activity, doing physical activities with parents and parental logistic support were identified as the most important, positive correlates of physical activity. Parental rules was the most important correlate of sedentary behaviour and was inversely related to it. School socio-economic status was positively related to physical activity and inversely related to sedentary behaviour. The available studies suggested a positive relationship between soft drink availability at home and consumption. Soft drink availability and consumption at school were the most important school-based correlates of soft drink consumption. A permissive parenting style was related to more soft drink consumption and less breakfast consumption. CONCLUSIONS: An important role has been awarded to parents, suggesting parents should be involved in obesity prevention programmes. Despite the opportunities a school can offer, little research has been done to identify school-environmental correlates of energy balance-related behaviours in this age group. Obesity prevention programmes can focus on the most important correlates to maximize the effectiveness of the programme. Future research should aim at longitudinal studies."
Family-based interventions for reducing sedentary time in youth: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials	"Family involvement in interventions to reduce sedentary time may help foster appropriate long-term screen-based habits in children. This review systematically synthesized evidence from randomized controlled trials of interventions with a family component that targeted reduction of sedentary time, including TV viewing, video games and computer use, in children. MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycInfo, CINAHL and Embase were searched from inception through March 2012. Seventeen articles were considered eligible and included in the review. Studies were judged to be at low-to-moderate risk of bias. Despite inconsistent study results, level of parental involvement, rather than the setting itself, appeared an important determinant of intervention success. Studies including a parental component of medium-to-high intensity were consistently associated with statistically significant changes in sedentary behaviours."
Family-Based Interventions in Preventing Children and Adolescents from Using Tobacco: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	"BACKGROUND: Tobacco is the main preventable cause of death and disease worldwide. Adolescent smoking is increasing in many countries with poorer countries following the earlier experiences of affluent countries. Preventing adolescents from starting smoking is crucial to decreasing tobacco-related illness. OBJECTIVE: To assess effectiveness of family-based interventions alone and combined with school-based interventions to prevent children and adolescents from initiating tobacco use. DATA SOURCES: Fourteen bibliographic databases and the Internet, journals hand-searched, and experts consulted. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with children or adolescents and families, interventions to prevent starting tobacco use, and follow-up >=6 months. STUDY APPRAISAL/SYNTHESIS METHODS: Abstracts/titles independently assessed and data independently entered by 2 authors. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool. RESULTS: Twenty-seven RCTs were included. Nine trials of never-smokers compared with a control provided data for meta-analysis. Family intervention trials had significantly fewer students who started smoking. Meta-analysis of 2 RCTs of combined family and school interventions compared with school only, showed additional significant benefit. The common feature of effective high-intensity interventions was encouraging authoritative parenting. LIMITATIONS: Only 14 RCTs provided data for meta-analysis (approximately a third of participants). Of the 13 RCTs that did not provide data for meta-analysis 8 compared a family intervention with no intervention and 1 reported significant effects, and 5 compared a family combined with school intervention with a school intervention only and none reported additional significant effects. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: There is moderate-quality evidence that family-based interventions prevent children and adolescents from starting to smoke.

Family-based prevention programmes for alcohol use in young people.	"BACKGROUND: Alcohol use in young people is a risk factor for a range of short- and long-term harms and is a cause of concern for health services, policy-makers, youth workers, teachers, and parents. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of universal, selective, and indicated family-based prevention programmes in preventing alcohol use or problem drinking in school-aged children (up to 18 years of age).Specifically, on these outcomes, the review aimed:* to assess the effectiveness of universal family-based prevention programmes for all children up to 18 years ('universal interventions');* to assess the effectiveness of selective family-based prevention programmes for children up to 18 years at elevated risk of alcohol use or problem drinking ('selective interventions'); and* to assess the effectiveness of indicated family-based prevention programmes for children up to 18 years who are currently consuming alcohol, or who have initiated use or regular use ('indicated interventions'). SEARCH METHODS: We identified relevant evidence from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid 1966 to June 2018), Embase (1988 to June 2018), Education Resource Information Center (ERIC; EBSCOhost; 1966 to June 2018), PsycINFO (Ovid 1806 to June 2018), and Google Scholar. We also searched clinical trial registers and handsearched references of topic-related systematic reviews and the included studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs (C-RCTs) involving the parents of school-aged children who were part of the general population with no known risk factors (universal interventions), were at elevated risk of alcohol use or problem drinking (selective interventions), or were already consuming alcohol (indicated interventions). Psychosocial or educational interventions involving parents with or without involvement of children were compared with no intervention, or with alternate (e.g. child only) interventions, allowing experimental isolation of parent components. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included 46 studies (39,822 participants), with 27 classified as universal, 12 as selective, and seven as indicated. We performed meta-analyses according to outcome, including studies reporting on the prevalence, frequency, or volume of alcohol use. The overall quality of evidence was low or very low, and there was high, unexplained heterogeneity.Upon comparing any family intervention to no intervention/standard care, we found no intervention effect on the prevalence (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.08 to 0.08; studies = 12; participants = 7490; I2 = 57%; low-quality evidence) or frequency (SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.83 to 0.21; studies = 8; participants = 1835; I2 = 96%; very low-quality evidence) of alcohol use in comparison with no intervention/standard care. The effect of any parent/family interventions on alcohol consumption volume compared with no intervention/standard care was very small (SMD -0.14, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.00; studies = 5; participants = 1825; I2 = 42%; low-quality evidence).When comparing parent/family and adolescent interventions versus interventions with young people alone, we found no difference in alcohol use prevalence (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.91 to 0.14; studies = 4; participants = 5640; I2 = 99%; very low-quality evidence) or frequency (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.09; studies = 4; participants = 915; I2 = 73%; very low-quality evidence). For this comparison, no trials reporting on the volume of alcohol use could be pooled in meta-analysis.In general, the results remained consistent in separate subgroup analyses of universal, selective, and indicated interventions. No adverse effects were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review indicate that there are no clear benefits of family-based programmes for alcohol use among young people. Patterns differ slightly across outcomes, but overall, the variation, heterogeneity, and number of analyses performed preclude any conclusions about intervention effects. Additional independent studies are required to strengthen the evidence and clarify the marginal effects observed."
Family-based programmes for preventing smoking by children and adolescents	"BACKGROUND: There is evidence that family and friends influence children's decisions to smoke. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of interventions to help families stop children starting smoking. SEARCH METHODS: We searched 14 electronic bibliographic databases, including the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group specialized register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL unpublished material, and key articles' reference lists. We performed free-text internet searches and targeted searches of appropriate websites, and hand-searched key journals not available electronically. We consulted authors and experts in the field. The most recent search was 3 April 2014. There were no date or language limitations. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions with children (aged 5-12) or adolescents (aged 13-18) and families to deter tobacco use. The primary outcome was the effect of the intervention on the smoking status of children who reported no use of tobacco at baseline. Included trials had to report outcomes measured at least six months from the start of the intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We reviewed all potentially relevant citations and retrieved the full text to determine whether the study was an RCT and matched our inclusion criteria. Two authors independently extracted study data for each RCT and assessed them for risk of bias. We pooled risk ratios using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effect model. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-seven RCTs were included. The interventions were very heterogeneous in the components of the family intervention, the other risk behaviours targeted alongside tobacco, the age of children at baseline and the length of follow-up. Two interventions were tested by two RCTs, one was tested by three RCTs and the remaining 20 distinct interventions were tested only by one RCT. Twenty-three interventions were tested in the USA, two in Europe, one in Australia and one in India.The control conditions fell into two main groups: no intervention or usual care; or school-based interventions provided to all participants. These two groups of studies were considered separately.Most studies had a judgement of 'unclear' for at least one risk of bias criteria, so the quality of evidence was downgraded to moderate. Although there was heterogeneity between studies there was little evidence of statistical heterogeneity in the results. We were unable to extract data from all studies in a format that allowed inclusion in a meta-analysis.There was moderate quality evidence family-based interventions had a positive impact on preventing smoking when compared to a no intervention control. Nine studies (4810 participants) reporting smoking uptake amongst baseline non-smokers could be pooled, but eight studies with about 5000 participants could not be pooled because of insufficient data. The pooled estimate detected a significant reduction in smoking behaviour in the intervention arms (risk ratio RR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval CI] 0.68 to 0.84). Most of these studies used intensive interventions. Estimates for the medium and low intensity subgroups were similar but confidence intervals were wide. Two studies in which some of the 4487 participants already had smoking experience at baseline did not detect evidence of effect (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.17).Eight RCTs compared a combined family plus school intervention to a school intervention only. Of the three studies with data, two RCTS with outcomes for 2301 baseline never smokers detected evidence of an effect (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.96) and one study with data for 1096 participants not restricted to never users at baseline also detected a benefit (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.94). The other five studies with about 18,500 participants did not report data in a format allowing meta-analysis. One RCT also compared a family intervention to a school 'good behaviour' intervention and did not detect a difference between the two types of programme (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.38, n = 388).No studies identified any adverse effects of intervention. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate quality evidence to suggest that family-based interventions can have a positive effect on preventing children and adolescents from starting to smoke. There were more studies of high intensity programmes compared to a control group receiving no intervention, than there were for other compairsons. The evidence is therefore strongest for high intensity programmes used independently of school interventions. Programmes typically addressed family functioning, and were introduced when children were between 11 and 14 years old. Based on this moderate quality evidence a family intervention might reduce uptake or experimentation with smoking by between 16 and 32%. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously because effect estimates could not include data from all studies. Our interpretation is that the common feature of the effective high intensity interventions was encouraging authoritative parenting (which is usually defined as showing strong interest in and care for the adolescent, often with rule setting). This is different from authoritarian parenting (do as I say) or neglectful or unsupervised parenting."
Family-Centered Care From the Perspective of Parents of Children Cared for in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit: An Integrative Review	"Problem The Institute for Patient- and Family-Centered Care's (IPFCC) definition of family-centered care (FCC) includes the following four core concepts: respect and dignity, information sharing, participation, and collaboration. To date, research has focused on the provider experience of FCC in the PICU; little is known about how parents of children hospitalized in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) experience FCC. Eligibility Criteria Articles were included if they were published between 2006 and 2016, included qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods results, related to care received in a PICU, and included results that were from a parent perspective. Sample 49 articles from 44 studies were included in this review; 32 used qualitative/mixed methods and 17 used quantitative designs. Results The concepts of respect and dignity, information sharing, and participation were well represented in the literature, as parents reported having both met and unmet needs in relation to FCC. While not explicitly defined in the IPFCC core concepts, parents frequently reported on the environment of care and its impact on their FCC experience. Conclusions As evidenced by this synthesis, parents of critically ill children report both positive and negative FCC experiences relating to the core concepts outlined by the IPFCC. Implications There is a need for better understanding of how parents perceive their involvement in the care of their critically ill child, additionally; the IPFCC core concepts should be refined to explicitly include the importance of the environment of care."
Family-related predictors of body weight and weight-related behaviours among children and adolescents: a systematic umbrella review	"This umbrella review analysed the relationships between family variables and child/adolescent body weight, diet and physical activity. In line with theories of health behaviour change, it was assumed that behaviour-specific family variables (i.e. beliefs, perceptions and practices referring to food intake or physical activity) would have stronger support than more general family variables (i.e. socio-economic status or general parental practices). Data obtained from 18 systematic reviews (examining 375 quantitative studies) were analysed. Reviews of experimental trials generally supported the effectiveness of reward/positive reinforcement parental strategies, parental involvement in treatment or prevention programmes, and cognitive-behavioural treatment in reducing child/adolescent body mass and/or obesity."
Father-Inclusive Perinatal Parent Education Programs: A Systematic Review	"CONTEXT: Fathers contribute to their children's health starting at the beginning of life. Few parent education programs include fathers. Among those that do, there is little effort to report program effects on father outcomes. OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review, we examined father-inclusive perinatal parent education programs in the United States as they relate to a range of father outcomes. DATA SOURCES: The databases searched were PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, Ovid Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PsycINFO. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they included an evaluation of a parent education program and a report of father outcomes measured within 1 year of the child's birth and were conducted within the United States. DATA EXTRACTION: Of 1353 total articles, 21 met study criteria. RESULTS: The overall state of the father-inclusive perinatal parent education program literature was poor, with few interventions available to fathers. Available programs were associated with increased father involvement, coparenting relationship, partner relationship quality, father's mental health, and father's supportive behaviors. Program effects on fatherinfant interaction, parenting knowledge, and attitudes and parenting self-efficacy were inconclusive. Three programs emerged as best evidence-based interventions. LIMITATIONS: Risk of bias was high for many studies. Outcome variability, small sample size, and publication bias contributed to the weak evidence base. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for more evidence-based interventions to support fathers. Clinicians play a key role in engaging fathers in early parent education programs and health care settings.

Fathering on Tenuous Ground: A Qualitative Meta-Synthesis on Teen Fathering.	"BACKGROUND: Although teen fathers are a vulnerable group of parents, they have received far less attention than teen mothers. PURPOSE: We conducted a systematic search of qualitative studies that examined their prenatal and postpartum experience to better understand teen fathers' concerns, strengths, and vulnerabilities. METHODS: We searched nine electronic databases through September 2017; 29 studies represented in 30 articles met study criteria. All authors independently extracted data from each article. Coding decisions were reviewed weekly and differences were settled by consensus. RESULTS: From pooling the results of 29 primary studies, we describe how a tenuous ground contributes to teen paternity and imperils young fathers' involvement with their children. In the best of circumstances, the ground begins to stabilize for teens who become involved parents despite significant challenges and hardships. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our results contribute to the visibility of teen fathers and the social disparities that imperil fathering. We provide clinical guidance for strengthening the ground for teen fathers and their families, recognizing that clinicians often encounter challenges such as interpersonal factors and sociocultural conditions that systematically erode fathers' ties to their children, partners, professional caregivers, and institutions."
"Features of Computer-Based Decision Aids: Systematic Review, Thematic Synthesis, and Meta-Analyses"	"BACKGROUND: Patient information and education, such as decision aids, are gradually moving toward online, computer-based environments. Considerable research has been conducted to guide content and presentation of decision aids. However, given the relatively new shift to computer-based support, little attention has been given to how multimedia and interactivity can improve upon paper-based decision aids. OBJECTIVE: The first objective of this review was to summarize published literature into a proposed classification of features that have been integrated into computer-based decision aids. Building on this classification, the second objective was to assess whether integration of specific features was associated with higher-quality decision making. METHODS: Relevant studies were located by searching MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL databases. The review identified studies that evaluated computer-based decision aids for adults faced with preference-sensitive medical decisions and reported quality of decision-making outcomes. A thematic synthesis was conducted to develop the classification of features. Subsequently, meta-analyses were conducted based on standardized mean differences (SMD) from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported knowledge or decisional conflict. Further subgroup analyses compared pooled SMDs for decision aids that incorporated a specific feature to other computer-based decision aids that did not incorporate the feature, to assess whether specific features improved quality of decision making. RESULTS: Of 3541 unique publications, 58 studies met the target criteria and were included in the thematic synthesis. The synthesis identified six features: content control, tailoring, patient narratives, explicit values clarification, feedback, and social support. A subset of 26 RCTs from the thematic synthesis was used to conduct the meta-analyses. As expected, computer-based decision aids performed better than usual care or alternative aids; however, some features performed better than others. Integration of content control improved quality of decision making (SMD 0.59 vs 0.23 for knowledge; SMD 0.39 vs 0.29 for decisional conflict). In contrast, tailoring reduced quality of decision making (SMD 0.40 vs 0.71 for knowledge; SMD 0.25 vs 0.52 for decisional conflict). Similarly, patient narratives also reduced quality of decision making (SMD 0.43 vs 0.65 for knowledge; SMD 0.17 vs 0.46 for decisional conflict). Results were varied for different types of explicit values clarification, feedback, and social support. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of media rich or interactive features into computer-based decision aids can improve quality of preference-sensitive decision making. However, this is an emerging field with limited evidence to guide use. The systematic review and thematic synthesis identified features that have been integrated into available computer-based decision aids, in an effort to facilitate reporting of these features and to promote integration of such features into decision aids. The meta-analyses and associated subgroup analyses provide preliminary evidence to support integration of specific features into future decision aids. Further research can focus on clarifying independent contributions of specific features through experimental designs and refining the designs of features to improve effectiveness."
Features of successful sexual health promotion programs for young people: findings from a review of systematic reviews	"ISSUE ADDRESSED: Young people have a high burden of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) problems, and it is important to reach this group through health promotion initiatives. We conducted a systematic review of reviews to identify successful elements of health promotion programs for improving SRH of young people. METHODS: We identified and collated systematic reviews published in 2005-2015 which focused on young people (10-24 years), reported on SRH outcomes (pregnancy, sexually transmissible infections, condoms/contraceptive use, risky sexual behaviour, sexual healthcare access or intimate partner violence), and included primary studies predominantly conducted in high-income countries. This report focuses on features of successful SRH programs identified in the interpretation and discussion of included systematic reviews. RESULTS: We identified 66 systematic reviews, of which 37 reported on program features which were anecdotally or statistically associated with improved program effectiveness and success. Common features of effective interventions were: longer term or repeated implementation; multi-setting and multi-component; parental involvement; culturally/gender/age appropriate; and inclusion of skills-building. SO WHAT?: There is marked consistency of features improving SRH program effectiveness for young people despite the wide variation in interventions reviewed. There is a need to better implement this knowledge in future programs, and our findings provide useful guidance for optimising the design of SRH interventions for young people.

Fibromyalgia and myofascial pain syndrome: Two sides of the same coin? A scoping review to determine the lexicon of the current diagnostic criteria	"Objective: Consistent terminology to describe the diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia (FM) and myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is required to address the reported inadequacies in diagnosis. The present review investigated intervention studies in FM and MPS populations to determine the lexicon of the current diagnostic criteria used to identify chronic musculoskeletal pain patients. Methods: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a scoping review to review systematically the literature obtained from five scientific databases between 1997 and February 2017. Included studies consisted of intervention studies that involved symptomatic musculoskeletal pain patients, of any age or gender, presenting with FM or MPS. Included studies were evaluated for musculoskeletal condition and the diagnostic criteria used to identify patient conditions. Extraction of study criteria focused on whether diagnostic criteria were explicitly stated, the diagnostic criteria used, physical findings, symptomatic duration and the profession of the healthcare provider who confirmed diagnosis. Results: We identified 493 interventions, of which 410 were related to FM and 83 to MPS. The lexicon of the diagnostic criteria used for MPS tended to be less consistent in comparison to FM criteria, with notable differences in all comparative categories. Conclusions: The current review identified inconsistencies associated with the lexicon of the diagnostic criteria used to diagnose FM and MPS, and showed that there is wide variability in the terminology currently being used. These findings may have important implications for future development of consistent criteria to diagnose FM and MPS patients accurately."
Five shared decision-making tools in 5 months: use of rapid reviews to develop decision boxes for seniors living with dementia and their caregivers.	"BACKGROUND: Decision support tools build upon comprehensive and timely syntheses of literature. Rapid reviews may allow supporting their development by omitting certain components of traditional systematic reviews. We thus aimed to describe a rapid review approach underlying the development of decision support tools, i.e., five decision boxes (DB) for shared decision-making between seniors living with dementia, their caregivers, and healthcare providers. METHOD: We included studies based on PICO questions (Participant, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) describing each of the five specific decision. We gave priority to higher quality evidence (e.g., systematic reviews). For each DB, we first identified secondary sources of literature, namely, clinical summaries, clinical practice guidelines, and systematic reviews. After an initial extraction, we searched for primary studies in academic databases and grey literature to fill gaps in evidence. We extracted study designs, sample sizes, populations, and probabilities of benefits/harms of the health options. A single reviewer conducted the literature search and study selection. The data extracted by one reviewer was verified by a second experienced reviewer. Two reviewers assessed the quality of the evidence. We converted all probabilities into absolute risks for ease of understanding. Two to five experts validated the content of each DB. We conducted descriptive statistical analyses on the review processes and resources required. RESULTS: The approach allowed screening of a limited number of references (range: 104 to 406/review). For each review, we included 15 to 26 studies, 2 to 10 health options, 11 to 62 health outcomes and we conducted 9 to 47 quality assessments. A team of ten reviewers with varying levels of expertise was supported at specific steps by an information specialist, a biostatistician, and a graphic designer. The time required to complete a rapid review varied from 7 to 31 weeks per review (mean +/- SD, 19 +/- 10 weeks). Data extraction required the most time (8 +/- 6.8 weeks). The average estimated cost of a rapid review was C$11,646 (SD = C$10,914). CONCLUSIONS: This approach enabled the development of clinical tools more rapidly than with a traditional systematic review. Future studies should evaluate the applicability of this approach to other teams/tools."
Focus Group in Community Mental Health Research: Need for Adaption	"The article presents an analysis of the use of focus groups in researching community mental health users, starting with the reasons for using them, their implementation in mental health service users' research, and the adaptations of focus group use when researching the experiences of users. Based on personal research experience and a review of scientific publications in the Google Scholar, Web of Science, ProQuest, EBSCOhost, and Scopus databases, 20 articles published between 2010 and 2016 were selected for targeted content analysis. A checklist for reporting on the use of focus groups with community mental health service users, aiming to improve the comparability, verifiability and validity was developed. Adaptations of the implementation of focus groups in relation to participants' characteristics were suggested. Focus groups are not only useful as a scientific research technique, but also for ensuring service users' participation in decision-making in community mental health and evaluating the quality of the mental health system and services."
Food Parenting Practices among Parents with Overweight and Obesity: A Systematic Review	"Given the links between parental obesity and eating psychopathology in their children, it is important to understand the mechanisms via which unhealthy relationships with eating are passed from generation to generation. The aim was to review research focusing on food-related parenting practices (FPPs) used by parents with overweight/obesity. Web of Science, PubMed and PsycINFO were searched. Studies that included a measure of FPPs were considered eligible and were required to have examined FPPs by parental weight status. Twenty studies were included. Single studies suggest differences between parents with healthy-weight vs. overweight/obesity with respect to; food accessibility, food availability and modelling. Multiple studies suggest that several parenting strategies do not differ according to parental weight status (child involvement, praise, use of food to control negative emotions, use of food-based threats and bribes, pressure, restriction, meal and snack routines, monitoring, and rules and limits). There was inconclusive evidence with respect to differences in parental control, encouragement and use of unstructured FPPs among parents with healthy-weight vs. overweight/obesity. The findings of this review imply some differences between parents with overweight/obesity and healthy-weight and the use of some food-related parenting practices, however, they should be interpreted with caution since research remains limited and is generally methodologically weak. The review highlights opportunities for further research, and suggests improvements to current measures of FPPs."
Formulation of evidence-based messages to promote the use of physical activity to prevent and manage Alzheimer's disease	"Background: The impending public health impact of Alzheimer's disease is tremendous. Physical activity is a promising intervention for preventing and managing Alzheimer's disease. However, there is a lack of evidence-based public health messaging to support this position. This paper describes the application of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II (AGREE-II) principles to formulate an evidence-based message to promote physical activity for the purposes of preventing and managing Alzheimer's disease.Methods: A messaging statement was developed using the AGREE-II instrument as guidance. Methods included (a) conducting a systematic review of reviews summarizing research on physical activity to prevent and manage Alzheimer's disease, and (b) engaging stakeholders to deliberate the evidence and formulate the messaging statement.Results: The evidence base consisted of seven systematic reviews focused on Alzheimer's disease prevention and 20 reviews focused on symptom management. Virtually all of the reviews of symptom management conflated patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with other dementias, and this limitation was reflected in the second part of the messaging statement. After deliberating the evidence base, an expert panel achieved consensus on the following statement: ""Regular participation in physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Among older adults with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, regular physical activity can improve performance of activities of daily living and mobility, and may improve general cognition and balance."" The statement was rated favourably by a sample of older adults and physicians who treat Alzheimer's disease patients in terms of its appropriateness, utility, and clarity.Conclusion: Public health and other organizations that promote physical activity, health and well-being to older adults are encouraged to use the evidence-based statement in their programs and resources. Researchers, clinicians, people with Alzheimer's disease and caregivers are encouraged to adopt the messaging statement and the recommendations in the companion informational resource."
Frailty and Clinical Outcomes in Advanced Heart Failure Patients Undergoing Left Ventricular Assist Device Implantation: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	"BACKGROUND: Frailty has been identified as a risk factor for adverse clinical outcomes after cardiac intervention or surgery. However, whether it increases the risk of adverse outcomes in patients undergoing left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy has been controversial. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the frailty measures and clinical outcomes of length of stay and mortality in this setting. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched until September 11, 2017, for studies evaluating the association between frailty and clinical outcomes in advanced heart failure patients undergoing LVAD implantation. RESULTS: A total of 46 and 79 entries were retrieved from our search strategy. A total of 13 studies involving 3435 patients were included in the final meta-analysis (mean age: 57.7 +/- 15.3 years; 79% male, follow-up duration was 13 +/- 14 months). Compared to nonfrail patients (n = 2721), frail patients (n = 579) had significantly longer time-to-extubation (n = 3; mean difference: 45 +/- 6 hours; I2: 0%) and hospital length of stay (n = 4; mean difference: 2.9 +/- 1.2 days; P = .001; I2: 21%). Frailty was not a predictor of inpatient or short-term mortality n = 3; hazard ratio (HR): 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66-2.26; P > .05; I2: 0%] but predicted long-term mortality (n = 7; HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.15-1.80; P = .001; I2: 0%). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty leads to significantly longer time to extubation, hospital length of stay, and long-term mortality in advanced heart failure patients who have undergone LVAD implantation. Older patients being considered for LVAD implantation should therefore be assessed for frailty status. The risk and benefit of the procedure should be explained to the patient, emphasizing that frailty increases the likelihood of adverse clinical outcomes.

Friending teens: systematic review of social media in adolescent and young adult health care	"BACKGROUND: Social media has emerged as a potentially powerful medium for communication with adolescents and young adults around their health choices. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this systematic review is to identify research on the use of social media for interacting with adolescents and young adults in order to achieve positive health outcomes. METHODS: A MEDLINE/PubMed electronic database search was performed between January 1, 2002 and October 1, 2013, using terms to identify peer-reviewed research in which social media and other Web 2.0 technologies were an important feature. We used a systematic approach to retrieve papers and extract relevant data. RESULTS: We identified 288 studies involving social media, of which 87 met criteria for inclusion; 75 studies were purely observational and 12 were interventional. The ways in which social media was leveraged by these studies included (1) observing adolescent and young adult behavior (n=77), (2) providing health information (n=13), (3) engaging the adolescent and young adult community (n=17), and (4) recruiting research participants (n=23). Common health topics addressed included high-risk sexual behaviors (n=23), alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use (n=19), Internet safety (n=8), mental health issues (n=18), medical conditions (n=11), or other specified issues (n=12). Several studies used more than one social media platform and addressed more than one health-related topic. CONCLUSIONS: Social media technologies offer an exciting new means for engaging and communicating with adolescents and young adults; it has been successfully used to engage this age group, identify behaviors, and provide appropriate intervention and education. Nevertheless, the majority of studies to date have been preliminary and limited in their methodologies, and mostly center around evaluating how adolescents and young adults use social media and the resulting implications on their health. Although these explorations are essential, further exploration and development of these strategies into building effective interventions is necessary."
From Epidemiological Knowledge to Improved Health: A Vision for Translational Epidemiology.	"Epidemiology should aim to improve population health; however, no consensus exists regarding the activities and skills that should be prioritized to achieve this goal. We performed a scoping review of articles addressing the translation of epidemiological knowledge into improved population health outcomes. We identified five themes in the translational epidemiology literature: foundations of epidemiological thinking, evidence-based public health or medicine, epidemiological education, implementation science, and community-engaged research (including literature on community-based participatory research). We then identified five priority areas for advancing translational epidemiology: (1) scientific engagement with public health; (2) public health communication; (3) epidemiological education; (4) epidemiology and implementation; and (5) community involvement. Using these priority areas as a starting point, we developed a conceptual framework of translational epidemiology that emphasizes interconnectedness and feedback between epidemiology, foundational science, and public health stakeholders. We also identified two to five representative principles in each priority area that could serve as the basis for advancing a vision of translational epidemiology. We believe that an emphasis on translational epidemiology can help the broader field to increase the efficiency of translating epidemiological knowledge into improved health outcomes and to achieve its goal of improving population health.

From Help-Seekers to Influential Users: A Systematic Review of Participation Styles in Online Health Communities	"BACKGROUND: Understanding how people participate in and contribute to online health communities (OHCs) is useful knowledge in multiple domains. It is helpful for community managers in developing strategies for building community, for organizations in disseminating information about health interventions, and for researchers in understanding the social dynamics of peer support. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine if any patterns were apparent in the nature of user participation across online health communities. METHODS: The current study involved a systematic review of all studies that have investigated the nature of participation in an online health community and have provided a quantifiable method for categorizing a person based on their participation style. A systematic search yielded 20 papers. RESULTS: Participatory styles were classified as either multidimensional (based on multiple metrics) or unidimensional (based on one metric). With respect to the multidimensional category, a total of 41 different participation styles were identified ranging from Influential Users who were leaders on the board to Topic-Focused Responders who focused on a specific topic and tended to respond to rather than initiate posts. However, there was little overlap in participation styles identified both across OHCs for different health conditions and within OHCs for specific health conditions. Five of the 41 styles emerged in more than one study (Hubs, Authorities, Facilitators, Prime Givers, and Discussants), but the remainder were reported in only one study. The focus of the unidimensional studies was on level of engagement and particularly on high-engaged users. Eight different metrics were used to evaluate level of engagement with the greatest focus on frequency of posts. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of high-engaged users based on high post frequency, the current review found little evidence for consistent participatory styles across different health communities. However, this area of research is in its infancy, with most of the studies included in the review being published in the last 2 years. Nevertheless, the review delivers a nomenclature for OHC participation styles and metrics and discusses important methodological issues that will provide a basis for future comparative research in the area. Further studies are required to systematically investigate a range of participatory styles, to investigate their association with different types of online health communities and to determine the contribution of different participatory styles within and across online health communities."
Gambling-related harms and homelessness: findings from a scoping review	"Purpose People experiencing homelessness are being identified as a potentially vulnerable group in relation to gambling-related harm. The purpose of this paper is to explore the links between gambling-related harm and homelessness.Design/methodology/approach A scoping review of the English-language literature was conducted in 2016-2017 using a wide range of international sources. Qualitative content analysis was employed to code and identify key themes within the literature.Findings Five themes were identified: emerging knowledge about why people experiencing homelessness may participate in gambling; emerging knowledge about the prevalence of gambling within the homeless population; the likelihood that gambling-related harm is under-reported within the homeless population; emerging knowledge about the extent that people experiencing homelessness access gambling support services; and limited awareness about the potential impact of gambling participation among people experiencing homelessness.Originality/value The paper reviews research concerning the links between gambling, gambling-related harm and homelessness, which may be relevant to those working with people experiencing homelessness."
Games Used With Serious Purposes: A Systematic Review of Interventions in Patients With Cerebral Palsy	"The purpose of the present systematic review was to examine extant research regarding the role of games used seriously in interventions with individuals with cerebral palsy. Therefore, PubMed, PsyINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, and IEEE databases were used. Search terms included: ""serious games"" OR ""online games"" OR ""video games"" OR ""videogame"" OR ""game based"" OR ""game"" AND ""intervention"" AND ""cerebral palsy."" After the full reading and quality assessment of the papers, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies reported high levels of compliance, motivation, and engagement with game-based interventions both at home and at the clinical setting intervention. Regarding the effectiveness of the use of games, the results of the studies show both positive and negative results regarding their effectiveness. The efficacy was reported to motor function (i.e., improvements in the arm function, hand coordination, functional mobility, balance and gait function, postural control, upper-limbs function) and physical activity. Findings of this review suggest that games are used as a complement to conventional therapies and not as a substitute. Practitioners often struggle to get their patients to complete the assigned homework tasks, as patients display low motivation to engage in prescribed exercises. Data of this review indicates the use of games as tools suited to promote patients' engagement in the therapy and potentiate therapeutic gains."
Getting england to be more physically active: Are the public health responsibility deal's physical activity pledges the answer?.	"Background: The Public Health Responsibility Deal (RD) in England is a public-private partnership involving voluntary pledges between government, industry, and other organisations to improve public health by addressing alcohol, food, health at work, and physical activity. This paper analyses the RD physical activity (PA) pledges in terms of the evidence of their potential effectiveness, and the likelihood that they have motivated actions among organisations that would not otherwise have taken place. Methods: We systematically reviewed evidence of the effectiveness of interventions proposed in four PA pledges of the RD, namely, those on physical activity in the community; physical activity guidelines; active travel; and physical activity in the workplace. We then analysed publically available data on RD signatory organisations' plans and progress towards achieving the physical activity pledges, and assessed the extent to which activities among organisations could be attributed to the RD. Results: Where combined with environmental approaches, interventions such as mass media campaigns to communicate the benefits of physical activity, active travel in children and adults, and workplace-related interventions could in principle be effective, if fully implemented. However, most activities proposed by each PA pledge involved providing information or enabling choice, which has limited effectiveness. Moreover, it was difficult to establish the extent of implementation of pledges within organisations, given that progress reports were mostly unavailable, and, where provided, it was difficult to ascertain their relevance to the RD pledges. Finally, 15 % of interventions listed in organisations' delivery plans were judged to be the result of participation in the RD, meaning that most actions taken by organisations were likely already under way, regardless of the RD. Conclusions: Irrespective of the nature of a public health policy to encourage physical activity, targets need to be evidence-based, well-defined, measurable and encourage organisations to go beyond business as usual. RD physical activity targets do not adequately fulfill these criteria."
Goal setting and strategies to enhance goal pursuit for adults with acquired disability participating in rehabilitation	"BACKGROUND: Goal setting is considered a key component of rehabilitation for adults with acquired disability, yet there is little consensus regarding the best strategies for undertaking goal setting and in which clinical contexts. It has also been unclear what effect, if any, goal setting has on health outcomes after rehabilitation. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of goal setting and strategies to enhance the pursuit of goals (i.e. how goals and progress towards goals are communicated, used, or shared) on improving health outcomes in adults with acquired disability participating in rehabilitation. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, four other databases and three trials registers to December 2013, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We did not impose any language or date restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs and quasi-RCTs evaluating the effects of goal setting or strategies to enhance goal pursuit in the context of adult rehabilitation for acquired disability. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently reviewed search results for inclusion. Grey literature searches were conducted and reviewed by a single author. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for included studies. We contacted study authors for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: We included 39 studies (27 RCTs, 6 cluster-RCTs, and 6 quasi-RCTs) involving 2846 participants in total. Studies ranged widely regarding clinical context and participants' primary health conditions. The most common health conditions included musculoskeletal disorders, brain injury, chronic pain, mental health conditions, and cardiovascular disease.Eighteen studies compared goal setting, with or without strategies to enhance goal pursuit, to no goal setting. These studies provide very low quality evidence that including any type of goal setting in the practice of adult rehabilitation is better than no goal setting for health-related quality of life or self-reported emotional status (8 studies; 446 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.88, indicative of a moderate effect size) and self-efficacy (3 studies; 108 participants; SMD 1.07, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.49, indicative of a moderate to large effect size). The evidence is inconclusive regarding whether goal setting results in improvements in social participation or activity levels, body structure or function, or levels of patient engagement in the rehabilitation process. Insufficient data are available to determine whether or not goal setting is associated with more or fewer adverse events compared to no goal setting.Fourteen studies compared structured goal setting approaches, with or without strategies to enhance goal pursuit, to 'usual care' that may have involved some goal setting but where no structured approach was followed. These studies provide very low quality evidence that more structured goal setting results in higher patient self-efficacy (2 studies; 134 participants; SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.71, indicative of a small effect size) and low quality evidence for greater satisfaction with service delivery (5 studies; 309 participants; SMD 0.33, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.56, indicative of a small effect size). The evidence was inconclusive regarding whether more structured goal setting approaches result in higher health-related quality of life or self-reported emotional status, social participation, activity levels, or improvements in body structure or function. Three studies in this group reported on adverse events (death, re-hospitalisation, or worsening symptoms), but insufficient data are available to determine whether structured goal setting is associated with more or fewer adverse events than usual care.A moderate degree of heterogeneity was observed in outcomes across all studies, but an insufficient number of studies was available to permit subgroup analysis to explore the reasons for this heterogeneity. The review also considers studies which investigate the effects of different approaches to enhancing goal pursuit, and studies which investigate different structured goal setting approaches. It also reports on secondary outcomes including goal attainment and healthcare utilisation. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is some very low quality evidence that goal setting may improve some outcomes for adults receiving rehabilitation for acquired disability. The best of this evidence appears to favour positive effects for psychosocial outcomes (i.e. health-related quality of life, emotional status, and self-efficacy) rather than physical ones. Due to study limitations, there is considerable uncertainty regarding these effects however, and further research is highly likely to change reported estimates of effect."
Going digital: a narrative overview of the clinical and organisational impacts of eHealth technologies in hospital practice.	"Objective The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of hospital-based eHealth technologies on quality, safety and efficiency of care and clinical outcomes. Methods Systematic reviews and reviews of systematic reviews of eHealth technologies published in PubMed/Medline/Cochrane Library between January 2010 and October 2015 were evaluated. Reviews of implementation issues, non-hospital settings or remote care or patient-focused technologies were excluded from analysis. Methodological quality was assessed using a validated appraisal tool. Outcome measures were benefits and harms relating to electronic medical records (EMRs), computerised physician order entry (CPOE), electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) and computerised decision support systems (CDSS). Results are presented as a narrative overview given marked study heterogeneity. Results Nineteen systematic reviews and two reviews of systematic reviews were included from 1197 abstracts, nine rated as high quality. For EMR functions, there was moderate-quality evidence of reduced hospitalisations and length of stay and low-quality evidence of improved organisational efficiency, greater accuracy of information and reduced documentation and process turnaround times. For CPOE functions, there was moderate-quality evidence of reductions in turnaround times and resource utilisation. For ePrescribing, there was moderate-quality evidence of substantially fewer medications errors and adverse drug events, greater guideline adherence, improved disease control and decreased dispensing turnaround times. For CDSS, there was moderate-quality evidence of increased use of preventive care and drug interaction reminders and alerts, increased use of diagnostic aids, more appropriate test ordering with fewer tests per patient, greater guideline adherence, improved processes of care and less disease morbidity. There was conflicting evidence regarding effects on in-patient mortality and overall costs. Reported harms were alert fatigue, increased technology interaction time, creation of disruptive workarounds and new prescribing errors. Conclusion eHealth technologies in hospital settings appear to improve efficiency and appropriateness of care, prescribing safety and disease control. Effects on mortality, readmissions, total costs and patient and provider experience remain uncertain. What is known about the topic? Healthcare systems internationally are undertaking large-scale digitisation programs with hospitals being a major focus. Although predictive analyses suggest that eHealth technologies have the potential to markedly transform health care delivery, contemporary peer-reviewed research evidence detailing their benefits and harms is limited. What does this paper add? This narrative overview of 19 systematic reviews and two reviews of systematic reviews published over the past 5 years provides a summary of cumulative evidence of clinical and organisational effects of contemporary eHealth technologies in hospital practice. EMRs have the potential to increase accuracy and completeness of clinical information, reduce documentation time and enhance information transfer and organisational efficiency. CPOE appears to improve laboratory turnaround times and decrease resource utilisation. ePrescribing significantly reduces medication errors and adverse drug events. CDSS, especially those used at the point of care and integrated into workflows, attract the strongest evidence for substantially increasing clinician adherence to guidelines, appropriateness of disease and treatment monitoring and optimal medication use. Evidence of effects of eHealth technologies on discrete clinical outcomes, such as morbid events, mortality and readmissions, is currently limited and conflicting. What are the implications for practitioners? eHealth technologies confer benefits in improving quality and safety of care with little evidence of major hazards. Whether EMRs and CPOE can affect clinical outcomes or overall costs in the absence of auxiliary support systems, such as ePrescribing and CDSS, remains unclear. eHealth technologies are evolving rapidly and the evidence base used to inform clinician and managerial decisions to invest in these technologies must be updated continually. More rigorous field research using appropriate evaluation methods is needed to better define real-world benefits and harms. Customisation of eHealth applications to the context of patient-centred care and management of highly complex patients with multimorbidity will be an ongoing challenge."
Group-based parent training programmes for improving emotional and behavioural adjustment in young children.	"Background Emotional and behavioural problems in children are common. Research suggests that parenting has an important role to play in helping children to become well-adjusted, and that the first few months and years are especially important. Parenting programmes may have a role to play in improving the emotional and behavioural adjustment of infants and toddlers, and this review examined their effectiveness with parents and carers of young children. Objectives 1. To establish whether group-based parenting programmes are effective in improving the emotional and behavioural adjustment of young children (maximum mean age of three years and 11 months); and 2. To assess whether parenting programmes are effective in the primary prevention of emotional and behavioural problems. Search methods In July 2015 we searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase (Ovid), and 10 other databases. We also searched two trial registers and handsearched reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. Selection criteria Two reviewers independently assessed the records retrieved by the search. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of group-based parenting programmes that had used at least one standardised instrument to measure emotional and behavioural adjustment in children. Data collection and analysis One reviewer extracted data and a second reviewer checked the extracted data. We presented the results for each outcome in each study as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, we combined the results in a meta-analysis using a random-effects model. We used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to assess the overall quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. Main results We identified 22 RCTs and two quasi-RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of group-based parenting programmes in improving the emotional and behavioural adjustment of children aged up to three years and 11 months (maximum mean age three years 11 months). Authors' conclusions The findings of this review, which relate to the broad group of universal and at-risk (targeted) children and parents, provide tentative support for the use of group-based parenting programmes to improve the overall emotional and behavioural adjustment of children with a maximum mean age of three years and 11 months, in the short-term. There is, however, a need for more research regarding the role that these programmes might play in the primary prevention of both emotional and behavioural problems, and their long-term effectiveness."
Guidelines for dementia or Parkinson's disease with depression or anxiety: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety remain under-diagnosed and under-treated in those with neurologic diseases such as dementia or Parkinson's Disease (PD). Our objectives were to first, to provide a synthesis of high quality guidelines available for the identification and management of depression or anxiety in those with dementia or PD. Second, to identify areas for improvement for future guidelines. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and EMBASE (2009 to July 24, 2015), grey literature (83 sources; July 24-Sept 6, 2015), and bibliographies of included studies. Included studies were evaluated for quality by four independent reviewers the AGREE II tool. Guideline characteristics, statements and recommendations relevant to depression or anxiety for dementia and PD were then extracted. (PROSPERO CRD: 42016014584) RESULTS: 8121 citations were reviewed with 31 full text articles included for assessment with the AGREE II tool. 17 were of sufficient quality for inclusion. Mean overall quality scores were between 4.25 to 6.5. Domain scores were lowest in the areas of stakeholder involvement, applicability, and editorial independence. Recommendations for the screening and diagnosis of depression were found for PD and dementia. There was little evidence to guide diagnosis or management of anxiety. Non-pharmacologic therapies were recommended for dementia patients. Most advocated pharmacologic treatment for depression, for both PD and dementia, but did not specify an agent due to lack of evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The available recent high quality guidelines outline several recommendations for the management of comorbid depression or anxiety in PD or dementia. However there remain significant gaps in the evidence."
"Gypsy, Roma and Traveller access to and engagement with health services: a systematic review"	"Background: Gypsy, Roma and Traveller people represent the most disadvantaged minority groups in Europe, having the poorest health outcomes. This systematic review addressed the question of how Gypsy, Roma and Traveller people access healthcare and what are the best ways to enhance their engagement with health services. Methods: Searches were conducted in 21 electronic databases complemented by a focussed Google search. Studies were included if they had sufficient focus on Gypsy, Roma or Traveller populations; reported data pertinent to healthcare service use or engagement and were published in English from 2000 to 2015. Study findings were analyzed thematically and a narrative synthesis reported. Results: Ninety-nine studies from 32 countries were included, covering a range of health services. Nearly one-half of the presented findings related to primary healthcare services. Reported barriers to health service usage related to organisation of health systems, discrimination, culture and language, health literacy, service-user attributes and economic barriers. Promising engagement strategies included specialist roles, outreach services, dedicated services, raising health awareness, handheld records, training for staff and collaborative working. Conclusion: This review provides evidence that Gypsy, Roma and Traveller populations across Europe struggle to exercise their right to healthcare on account of multiple barriers; and related to other determinants of disadvantage such as low literacy levels and experiences of discrimination. Some promising strategies to overcome barriers were reported but the evidence is weak; therefore, rigorous evaluations of interventions to improve access to and engagement with health services for Gypsy, Roma and Traveller people are needed.

Hatha Yoga and Executive Function: A Systematic Review	"INTRODUCTION: Recent reviews have documented the beneficial effects of seated meditation on executive function (EF). However, there has yet to be a comprehensive review on the effects of Hatha yoga, a moving meditation, on EF. OBJECTIVE: To examine the empirical literature on the effects of Hatha yoga on EF. METHODS: MEDLINE, Scopus, and PsycINFO databases were searched for experimental studies (between- or within-subject designs) testing the effects of Hatha yoga (acute bouts, short-term interventions, longer-term interventions) on EF. RESULTS: A total of 11 published studies met eligibility criteria: Three studies involved healthy adults, 2 studies involved healthy older adults (n = 2), 1 study involved children and adolescents, and 5 studies involved medical (n = 4) or forensic (n = 1) populations. In healthy adults, 2 of 3 studies suggested that acute bouts of Hatha yoga improved EF; however, 1 study using a short-term intervention found no improvements in EF. Among healthy older adults, 1 study provided evidence that Hatha yoga improves EF. In child/adolescent samples, 1 study supported the contention that Hatha yoga improves EF after short-term interventions. Among medical populations, EF improved in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and in 1 of 3 studies involving patients with multiple sclerosis. The sole study involving impulsive prisoners showed positive effects on EF with a short-term intervention. CONCLUSION: Hatha yoga shows promise of benefit for EF in healthy adults, children, adolescents, healthy older adults, impulsive prisoners, and medical populations (with the exception of multiple sclerosis). However, more good-quality studies that evaluate the efficacy of Hatha yoga's effects on EF are essential to build on this evidence base."
Health at hand: A systematic review of smart watch uses for health and wellness	"INTRODUCTION: Smart watches have the potential to support health in everyday living by: enabling self-monitoring of personal activity; obtaining feedback based on activity measures; allowing for in-situ surveys to identify patterns of behavior; and supporting bi-directional communication with health care providers and family members. However, smart watches are an emerging technology and research with these devices is at a nascent stage. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of smart watch studies that engaged people in their use by searching PubMed, Embase, IEEE XPlore and ACM Digital libraries. Participant demographics, device features, watch applications and methods, and technical challenges were abstracted from included studies. RESULTS: Seventy-three studies were returned in the search. Seventeen studies published were included. Included studies were published from 2014 to 2016, with the exception of one published in 2011. Most studies employed the use of consumer-grade smart watches (14/17, 82%). Patient-related studies focused on activity monitoring, heart rate monitoring, speech therapy adherence, diabetes self-management, and detection of seizures, tremors, scratching, eating, and medication-taking behaviors. Most patient-related studies enrolled participants with few exclusion criteria to validate smart watch function (10/17, 58%). Only studies that focused on Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and diabetes management enrolled persons living with targeted conditions. One study focused on nursing work in the ICU and one focused on CPR training for laypeople. CONCLUSION: Consumer-grade smart watches have penetrated the health research space rapidly since 2014. Smart watch technical function, acceptability, and effectiveness in supporting health must be validated in larger field studies that enroll actual participants living with the conditions these devices target.

Health literacy and informed decision making regarding colorectal cancer screening: a systematic review	"Making an informed decision about participation in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening may be challenging for invitees with lower health literacy skills. The aim of this systematic review is to explore to what extent the level of a person's health literacy is related to their informed decision making concerning CRC screening. We searched for peer-reviewed studies published between 1950 and May 2013 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciSearch and PsycINFO. Studies were included when health literacy was studied in relation to concepts underpinning informed decision making (awareness, risk perception, perceived barriers and benefits, knowledge, attitude, deliberation). The quality of the studies was determined and related to the study results. The search returned 2254 papers. Eight studies in total were included, among which seven focused on knowledge, four focused on attitudes or beliefs concerning CRC screening, and one focused on risk perception. The studies found either no association or a positive association between health literacy and concepts underpinning informed decision making. Some studies showed that higher health literacy was associated with more CRC screening knowledge and a more positive attitude toward CRC screening. The results of studies that obtained a lower quality score were no different than studies that obtained a higher quality score. In order to obtain more insight into the association between health literacy and informed decision making in CRC cancer screening, future research should study the multiple aspects of informed decision making in conjunction instead of single aspects.

Health Literacy and Women's Reproductive Health: A Systematic Review	"BACKGROUND: Health literacy is thought to impact women's reproductive health, yet no comprehensive systematic reviews have been conducted on the topic. Our objective was to systematically identify, investigate, and summarize research on the relationship between health literacy and women's reproductive health knowledge, behaviors, and outcomes. METHODS: PRISMA guidelines were used to guide this review. English language, peer-reviewed research articles indexed in MEDLINE as of February 2015 were searched, along with study results posted on Clinicaltrials.gov . Articles were included if they (1) described original data-driven research conducted in developed countries, (2) were published in a peer-reviewed journal, (3) measured health literacy using a validated assessment, (4) reported on the relationship between health literacy and reproductive health outcomes, related knowledge, or behaviors, and (5) consisted of a study population that included reproductive age women. RESULTS: A total of 34 articles met eligibility criteria and were included in this review. Data were abstracted from articles by two study authors using a standardized form. Abstracted data were then reviewed and summarized in table format. Overall, health literacy was associated with reproductive health knowledge across a spectrum of topics. It was also related to certain health behaviors, such as prenatal vitamin use and breastfeeding. Its relationship with other reproductive behaviors and outcomes remains unclear. CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy plays an important role in reproductive knowledge and may impact behaviors and outcomes. While further research is necessary, healthcare providers should utilize health literacy best practices now to promote high-quality care for patients."
"Health Literacy in Web-Based Health Information Environments: Systematic Review of Concepts, Definitions, and Operationalization for Measurement"	"BACKGROUND: Health literacy research seems to lack a consensus on what aspects to include into literacy in the context of health and on how to operationalize these concepts for measurement purposes. In addition to health literacy, several other concepts, such as electronic health (eHealth) literacy and mental health literacy, have been developed across disciplines. This study examines how these different concepts are used when studying health-related competencies in Web contexts. OBJECTIVE: This study systematically reviews health literacy concepts and definitions and their operationalization in studies focused on Web-based health information environments. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in April 2016 in 6 electronic databases with a limitation to articles in English published between January 2011 and April 2016. Altogether, 1289 unique records were identified and screened according to the predefined inclusion criteria: (1) original, peer-reviewed research articles written in English; (2) the topic of the article concerned literacy in the context of health; (3) informants of the study were lay people, not health professionals or students of the field; and (4) the focus of the study was placed on an Web-based information environment. In total, 180 full texts were screened, of which 68 were included in the review. The studies were analyzed with an emphasis on the used health literacy concepts and measures. RESULTS: On the basis of the included studies, several concepts are in use when studying health-related literacy in Web environments, eHealth literacy and health literacy being the most common ones. The reviewed studies represent a variety of disciplines, but mostly medical sciences. Typically, quantitative research methods are used. On the basis of the definitions for health literacy, 3 thematic categories were identified: general and skill-based, multidimensional, and domain-specific health literacy. Most studies adopted a domain-specific concept, followed by the ones that used a general and skill-based concept. Multidimensional concepts occurred least frequently. The general health literacy concepts were usually operationalized with reading comprehension measures, the domain-specific concepts with self-efficacy measures, and multidimensional concepts with several types of measures. However, inconsistencies in operationalization were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that in studies conducted in Web-based information environments, several different health literacy concepts are in use, and there is no clear consensus on the definitions for these concepts. Future studies should place emphasis on the conceptual development of health literacy in Web contexts to gain better results on operationalization for measurement. Researchers are encouraged to provide clear operational definitions for the concepts they use to ensure transparency in reporting. Copyright ¬©Anna-Maija Huhta, Noora Hirvonen, Maija-Leena Huotari.

Health literacy interventions for immigrant populations: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Health literacy is considered a social health determinant that influences improvement in health, patient empowerment and reduction in inequalities. There is a lack of health literacy interventions for vulnerable social groups (i.e. immigrants), and nurses have shown little familiarity with the concept. AIM: This study aimed to identify and analyse whether interventions directed at immigrant populations improve the functional (basic reading, writing and arithmetic skills), interactive (social and cognitive skills) and critical (advanced cognitive and social skills in critically analyzing information and making informed decisions) dimensions of health literacy, taking into account the role played by nursing in these interventions. METHODS: A systematic review of four databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library and ERIC was conducted to identify relevant articles published between 2000 and 2015. Thirty-four articles met the inclusion criteria, and nine articles used a validated instrument. RESULTS: Few specific health literacy interventions for immigrant populations were found. The main findings of the studies showed positive changes in functional health literacy. However, the interventions were less effective in improving interactive and critical health literacy. LIMITATIONS: Several of the findings of this review were based on studies that had their own limitations. The assessment of the articles was not blinded, and the review was restricted to articles written in Spanish and English. CONCLUSIONS: The interventions studied were reported as being effective in improving health literacy in immigrants, particularly the functional aspects. Regarding the role played by nursing, this review observed little involvement. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: It is important for educational strategies to include health literacy dimensions. The concept of health literacy should be included as a Nursing Outcomes Classification and in its subsequent validation taxonomy. To promote community health, health literacy must be a prioritized objective of health management and policies. Copyright ¬© 2017 International Council of Nurses."
Health Literacy Studies Conducted in Australia: A Scoping Review	"Health literacy (HL) is an essential component of various literacies mentioned in the field of health and education, including cultural, technological, media and scientific literacies. It is important for motivating higher consumer engagement. We aimed to review previous studies of HL in Australia to inform future studies, extend current knowledge and further enhance HL. Using search strings, a systematic search of four databases (i.e., MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL and Eric) was carried out. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) based search strategy led to identification of a total of N = 9696 records, that were further screened for inclusion in the review. The review findings were categorized into three major themes: (1) HL and health numeracy; (2) contrast of: knowledge deficiency, knowledge gained, problems of current health care system and (3) HL measurement methods and its domains. The findings from this scoping review show a dearth of measurement tools with sound psychometric properties for assessing HL. The findings also reveal low levels of HL in consumers which is in turn affecting health-related behaviors, utilization of health services and navigation of the health system. More recent developments have tried to integrate vital aspects, including introduction of applications to increase HL and exploring HL in Aboriginal communities."
Health supports needed for homeless persons transitioning from hospitals	"Being homeless has a negative effect on health and the health needs of individuals experiencing homelessness are complex and challenging to address. As a result of limited access to and use of primary healthcare, the main point of entry into the healthcare system for individuals experiencing homelessness is often hospitals and emergency departments. Persons experiencing homelessness are commonly discharged from hospital settings to locations that do not support recovery or access to follow-up care (e.g. shelters or the street). This can be costly to both the healthcare system and to individuals' health and quality of life. We conducted a scoping review of the literature published between 2007 and 2017 to identify the types of health supports needed for persons experiencing homelessness who are discharged from the hospital. Thirteen literature sources met inclusion criteria and thematic data analyses by two researchers resulted in the identification of six themes related to the types of health supports needed for persons experiencing homelessness who are transitioning (i.e. being discharged) from the hospital. Using a community consultation approach, the scoping review themes were validated with 23 health and shelter service providers and included in our integrated findings. Themes included: (a) a respectful and understanding approach to care, (b) housing assessments, (c) communication/coordination/navigation, (d) supports for after-care, (e) complex medical care and medication management, and (f) basic needs and transportation. These themes were found to resonate with participants of the community consultation workshop. Recommendations for trauma-informed care and patient- or client-centred care approaches are discussed.

Healthcare Users' Experiences of Communicating with Healthcare Professionals About Children Who Have Life-Limiting Conditions: A Qualitative Systematic Review.	"BACKGROUND: Globally, an estimated eight million children could benefit from palliative care each year. Effective communication about children with life-limiting conditions is well recognized as a critical component of high-quality pediatric palliative care. OBJECTIVE: To synthesize existing qualitative research exploring healthcare users' experiences of communicating with healthcare professionals about children with life-limiting conditions. DESIGN: The results of a systematic literature search were screened independently by two reviewers. Raw data and analytic claims were extracted from included studies and were synthesized using thematic analysis methods for systematic reviews. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, and ScienceDirect were searched for articles published in English between 1990 and May 2017. RESULTS: This review included 29 studies conducted across 11 countries and involving at least 979 healthcare users (adults n = 914], patients n = 25], and siblings n = 40]). The four domains of communication experience identified through thematic synthesis are: Information, Emotion, Collaboration, and Relationship. Although included studies were from a range of settings and diverse populations, further research is needed to explore whether and how domains of communication experience differ across settings and populations. In particular, further research about children's palliative care experiences is needed. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare users typically value communication with healthcare professionals: that (1) is open and honest, (2) acknowledges emotion, (3) actively involves healthcare users, and (4) occurs within established and trusting relationships."
Hearing Their Voice: A Systematic Review of Dementia Family Caregivers' Needs	"PURPOSE: The number of Australians living with dementia is expected to increase from currently 332,000 to 900,000 by 2050. Around 200,000 unpaid caregivers are caring for community-dwelling people living with dementia, and therefore, supporting the caregivers' needs is of paramount importance. The aim of this systematic review was to understand the perceived needs of immediate family caregivers of community-dwelling older adults with dementia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined qualitative studies that reported on the self-perceived needs of partner and/or offspring caregivers who were caring for community-dwelling older adults with dementia. RESULTS: Two themes were developed from 12 studies: caregiver needs related to the management of older people with dementia and caregivers' personal needs. The first theme further included four subthemes: information and knowledge needs; activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living and Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia support needs; formal care support needs; and informal care support needs. The second theme consisted of two subthemes: the need to address caregivers' physical and psychological health and the need to manage caregivers' own lives. IMPLICATIONS: The findings have important implications for the development of interventions that comprehensively address caregivers' individual needs. Caregivers' unmet needs highlight key areas for improvement in policy and service provision. The findings demonstrate the need for more rigorous qualitative studies exploring the perceived needs of partner and offspring caregivers respectively. Furthermore, examining the underlying relationships between different caregiver needs is warranted. Copyright ¬© The Author 2016.

Helping With Meal Preparation and Children's Dietary Intake: A Literature Review.	"Most children and adolescents do not meet dietary recommendations that may result in poor diets contributing to obesity. This systematic literature review was conducted to examine associations between helping with meal preparation at home and dietary quality, intake of specific foods, and/or dietary-related perceptions among youth. A search of databases using key terms was conducted for studies meeting criteria. This literature review included 15 studies using a cross-sectional descriptive design, with two studies also including a longitudinal design. Data were self-reported (or parent-reported) using various surveys and/or interviews. Study findings supported positive associations between youth involvement in home meal preparation and improvement in overall dietary quality, increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, greater preference for vegetables, and higher self-efficacy for cooking and choosing healthy foods. Further research is needed to develop efficacious meal preparation interventions involving parents and their children to promote this mealtime behavior with many potential health benefits."
Home or foster home care versus institutional long-term care for functionally dependent older people.	"Background Changing population demographics have led to an increasing number of functionally dependent older people who require care and medical treatment. In many countries, government policy aims to shift resources into the community from institutional care settings with the expectation that this will reduce costs and improve the quality of care compared. Objectives To assess the effects of long-term home or foster home care versus institutional care for functionally dependent older people. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and two trials registers to November 2015. Selection criteria We included randomised and non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series studies complying with the EPOC study design criteria and comparing the effects of long-term home care versus institutional care for functionally dependent older people. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of each included study. We reported the results narratively, as the substantial heterogeneity across studies meant that meta-analysis was not appropriate. Main results We included 10 studies involving 16,377 participants, all of which were conducted in high income countries. Included studies compared community-based care with institutional care (care homes). The sample size ranged from 98 to 11,803 (median N = 204). There was substantial heterogeneity in the healthcare context, interventions studied, and outcomes assessed. One study was a randomised trial (N = 112); other included studies used designs that had potential for bias, particularly due lack of randomisation, baseline imbalances, and non-blinded outcome assessment. Most studies did not select (or exclude) participants for any specific disease state, with the exception of one study that only included patients if they had a stroke. All studies had methodological limitations, so readers should interpret results with caution. Authors' conclusions There are insufficient high-quality published data to support any particular model of care for functionally dependent older people. Community-based care was not consistently beneficial across all the included studies; there were some data suggesting that community-based care may be associated with improved quality of life and physical function compared to institutional care. However, community alternatives to institutional care may be associated with increased risk of hospitalisation. Future studies should assess healthcare utilisation, perform economic analysis, and consider caregiver burden."
Home-based educational interventions for children with asthma.	"Background While guidelines recommend that children with asthma should receive asthma education, it is not known if education delivered in the home is superior to usual care or the same education delivered elsewhere. The home setting allows educators to reach populations (such as the economically disadvantaged) that may experience barriers to care (such as lack of transportation) within a familiar environment. Objectives To perform a systematic review on educational interventions for asthma delivered in the home to children, caregivers or both, and to determine the effects of such interventions on asthma-related health outcomes. We also planned to make the education interventions accessible to readers by summarising the content and components. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, which includes the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and PsycINFO, and handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. We also searched the Education Resources Information Center database (ERIC), reference lists of trials and review articles (last search January 2011). Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of asthma education delivered in the home to children, their caregivers or both. In the first comparison, eligible control groups were provided usual care or the same education delivered outside of the home. For the second comparison, control groups received a less intensive educational intervention delivered in the home. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected the trials, assessed trial quality and extracted the data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We pooled dichotomous data with fixed-effect odds ratio and continuous data with mean difference (MD) using a fixed-effect where possible. Main results A total of 12 studies involving 2342 children were included. Eleven out of 12 trials were conducted in North America, within urban or suburban settings involving vulnerable populations. The studies were overall of good methodological quality. They differed markedly in terms of age, severity of asthma, context and content of the educational intervention leading to substantial clinical heterogeneity. Due to this clinical heterogeneity, we did not pool results for our primary outcome, the number of patients with exacerbations requiring emergency department (ED) visit. The mean number of exacerbations requiring ED visits per person at six months was not significantly different between the home-based intervention and control groups (N = 2 studies; MD 0.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.20 to 0.27). Only one trial contributed to our other primary outcome, exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids. Hospital admissions also demonstrated wide variation between trials with significant changes in some trials in both directions. Quality of life improved in both education and control groups over time. Authors' conclusions We found inconsistent evidence for home-based asthma educational interventions compared to standard care, education delivered outside of the home or a less intensive educational intervention delivered at home. Although education remains a key component of managing asthma in children, advocated in numerous guidelines, this review does not contribute further information on the fundamental content and optimum setting for such educational interventions."
Home-Based Interventions to Treat and Prevent Childhood Obesity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	"Childhood obesity has adverse impacts on premature mortality and morbidity. Managing obesity could prevent premature mortality and several types of complications among high-risk groups. This study aimed to review and examine the effects of home-based interventions to treat and prevent childhood obesity. Three databases, i.e., PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct, were included to extract articles related to the topic. The terms ""childhood obesity"", ""home-based intervention"", ""parental program"", and ""parental involvement"" were used as the primary keywords. Appraisal of the systematic review was based on PRISMA formats. Of 1556 publications identified, 22 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were appropriate to conduct a meta-analysis. Overall, the home-based interventions reduced the body mass index (BMI) z-score by 36.99% (z = 36.99, p = 0.00). The data analysis indicated considerable heterogeneity among all interventions (Chi-square = 926.41, df = 22 (p 2 = 98%). The home-based intervention positively reduced BMI. Our findings could guide future meaningful home-based interventions to treat and prevent childhood obesity."
Homecare safety and medication management with older adults: a scoping review of the quantitative and qualitative evidence	"Background Healthcare safety is a current national and international priority, and within healthcare safety, one of the most prevalent, high-risk issues is medication safety. While medication safety in general demands consideration, there is a critical gap in our understanding of medication safety in the homecare sector. Understanding what factors contribute to, and/or reduce the risk of adverse drug events in the home setting will enable the identification and promotion of safer medication administration practices. Objectives In this review we focused on the pertinent issues specifically related to medication management for individuals living at home and receiving homecare services. Inclusion criteria Types of participants We considered studies that included older individuals, mean age 65 years or older, who were receiving homecare services. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest We considered studies that focused on individuals living at home and receiving homecare services and evaluated the process of medication management involving either providers (licensed and unlicensed) or caregivers (family/friends paid or unpaid). Types of studies We included all quantitative and qualitative research designs. Types of outcomes The purpose of this review was to map existing literature on this topic and to identify what outcomes were being measured by the current research. Research to date has identified outcomes such as: death, re-hospitalization, emergency room use and adverse drug reactions; adherence; deterioration in primary condition; and experience of medication management (individual report and/or provider/caregiver report). Search strategy A three-step search strategy was utilized in this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL was undertaken followed by an analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe the article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms was then undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles were searched for additional studies. Studies published in English and French were considered for inclusion in this review. No date limitation was imposed. Methodological quality This review is a scoping review to provide a broader picture of the existing literature on this topic. Hence, assessment of methodological quality was not performed to exclude studies based on quality scores. Data collection Data was extracted using an expanded extraction tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute MetaAnalysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). Data synthesis The findings are presented in narrative form including tables and figures to aid in data presentation where appropriate. Results Thirty-six studies published in English were included in this review. No French studies were located. Research designs of the included studies are heavily weighted in descriptive designs (n=28), one randomized controlled trial, three controlled before and after designs, three pre-post designs and one qualitative design. There was a single mixed methods study combining results from a pre-post (not controlled) investigation and qualitative focus groups. There was a single qualitative study using interpretive qualitative methods. Following the three research questions proposed for this review, three main categories were analyzed: issues (including contributing factors and risk factors) (n=21 studies), documented adverse events or errors that occur in the homecare environment (n=13 studies), and strategies or interventions to prevent the occurrence of errors in the homecare environment (n=11 studies). Conclusions In this scoping review, we sought to gather information to shed light on the current evidence related to medication management in the homecare setting. This is an area of emerging evidence on both the issue and risks in this context, as well interventions to ameliorate the problems. There was a common theme that did emerge across the study designs with respect to polypharmacy, which is recognized as a significant issue and predictor of medication errors, and/or potential inappropriate medication use. Benefits were reported by two experimental studies with the inclusion of a pharmacist to assess medications: improvements in medication use and increased coordination of information between healthcare providers and individuals. Further evidence describing and substantiating the issues and problems specific to home care and medication management is needed to develop and test appropriate interventions in this setting."
Homecare safety and medication management: a scoping review of the quantitative and qualitative evidence	"Introduction Patient safety is a current national and international priority, and one of the most prevalent, high-risk fields within patient safety is medication safety.1-4 The links in the chain of events necessary for medication safety include assessment, prescription, dispensing, and monitoring of medications. A weakness in any one of these essential links or a tenuous connection between links may result in an adverse event and harm to the patient. While medication safety in general demands consideration, there is a critical gap in our understanding of medication safety in the home care sector. Understanding what factors contribute to, and/or reduce the risk of adverse drug events in the home setting will enable the identification and promotion of safer medication administration practices. Key Definitions Homecare research and literature is rife with inconsistent terminology related to roles. Thus, discussion of medication safety in homecare necessitates clarification of terms. For the purposes of this discussion, caregivers refers to family members or friends in a paid or unpaid role who are responsible for or charged with caring for the patient. Family members are individuals identified by the patient and/or caregiver as being close to the patient through blood, legal, or emotional ties, and who may or may not reside in the same home as the patient. Finally, providers are employees of organizations providing homecare services. Providers may be professionals or non-professionals, and regulated or unregulated (e.g. case managers, nurses, aides, pharmacists, and therapists.) Compromised Medication Safety for Older Adults When medications are not managed safely, the associated costs for patients, their caregivers/families, providers, and the healthcare system can be severe.4-10 There is limited evidence from the international literature on safety in homecare or safety in medication management in home care. However, Canadian studies indicate that as many as one in five hospitalized Canadians suffer adverse events following their discharge home, and two thirds of those events are related to compromised medication safety.11-13 Furthermore, patients themselves have identified problematic outcomes related to insufficient medication safety processes. For example, in the Commonwealth Survey (2002), 11% of Canadian patients reported that they received an incorrect medication at least once.14 Medication safety issues are often augmented for older adults. Management of multiple chronic illnesses as well as other care needs frequently compounds the complexity of the medication regimens common in this population. In CanadaÄüs seniors, the total annual cost of preventable drug-related morbidity (PDRM) was estimated to be $11 billion in 2000.7 In addition, a recent study observed that up to one in 11 seniors in Halifax, Nova Scotia experienced a PDRM within a two-year period.15 Many of these lapses in medication safety occur in patientsÄü homes. Because of the myriad of issues faced by elderly homecare recipients, this review will focus on medication safety issues for older adults who receive homecare services, their caregivers/families, and providers. Complexity of Care in the Home Homecare is inherently complex, and the demands on the knowledge, ability, energy, and finances of patients and their families/caregivers are intensifying as a result of increasing acuity of patients, decreasing length of hospital stays, and increasing availability of mobile health care technology such as peritoneal and hemodialysis, long term intravenous catheters, and oxygen/inhalation therapy.16 Family relationships, the home environment, which is not designed for providing health care, and the cognitive and physical abilities of both patients and caregivers further influence care provision. While in-hospital, care is predominantly the responsibility of regulated professional providers who work in shifts whereas unregulated providers, family, and caregivers provide much of the care in private homes.17 Caregivers for home care patients are frequently elderly, and they often grapple with health challenges of their own in addition to lack of sleep as they provide around-the-clock care with little assistance or relief. Family and caregivers often agree to care for patients at home out of love and/or a sense of responsibility, but are unaware of the extent of the commitment involved and the drastic impact it can have on their own lives and health.18;19 Additionally, providers who work in patientsÄü homes are exposed to the risks inherent in providing care alone in an unregulated and potentially ill-equipped setting. Thus, the safety of the patient, caregiver/family, and provider are inextricably linked, and the care and safety of patients around medication management cannot be addressed without including caregivers, family members, and providers in the equation.20-22 Medication Safety in Homecare Current medication safety research focuses predominantly on institutions and paid providers. This research may have little applicability to the homecare setting, just as the traditional means of identifying and describing medication errors (e.g. Äúdrug without indicationÄù or Äúindication without drugÄù23) may be neither sufficient nor practical for homecare.24 Assessing medication-related problems in the home often demands consideration of issues that are often irrelevant in the hospital setting. Examples of these are economic issues, such as whether the patient can afford to fill his or her prescriptions; access issues, such as whether the patient has the physical capacity to get to a pharmacy; and social issues, such as living with an overwhelmed caregiver who has his or her own health concerns. Additionally, there is a great deal of variation in the abilities of caregivers, many of whom are lay people with no formal health care training. There is little in the way of education or preparation for these caregivers, who manage an array of medications in potentially ill-equipped home settings, frequently while under the influence of stress and fatigue. Though providers can help to alleviate risks through assessment and collaborative discussions with patients and caregivers, the nature of the home setting requires patients and caregivers to make frequent autonomous decisions about medication use with minimal professional supervision, and deficient or absent home and community supports.17 In addition, the home setting presents unique difficulties in documentation and communication related to medications. Research shows points of transfer across sectors already hold increased challenges in these essential functions.11-13;25 One related danger to homecare patients is the implications of insufficient communication for medication reconciliation, defined as the Äúsystematic and comprehensive review of all the medications a patient is taking to ensure that medications being added, changed or discontinued are carefully assessed and documented.Äù26,p.5 As the potential for receiving inappropriate medication increases, so too does the potential for harmful incidents (an incident which results in harm to a patient).27,p.23 Shifting Perspective: New Knowledge Requirements Homecare continues to be chronically under-funded within a health care system dominated by the acute care setting, despite an ever-increasing demand for homecare services. Health care strategies for the elderly, including seniors with chronic conditions and those that need end-of-life care, require a fundamental change in perspective. This change is necessary from a short-term, disease-oriented perspective with an emphasis on diagnosis and treatment, as well as from a long-term perspective with an emphasis on functional capacity, health maintenance, prevention of further deterioration, health promotion for the patient and caregivers/families, as well as comfort and supportive care. This shift in perspective calls for a new set of competencies (education, skills), and alternative approaches (including behavioral strategies) to care for these patients and caregivers/families. The safety implications for medication management in home care need to be addressed in relation to service provision for vulnerable patients (i.e., elderly, chronically and/or terminally ill), ethical considerations for the myriad of daily decisions in homecare, and the critical role of patients, caregivers, and family members as integral members of the health care delivery team. In line with the view proposed by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR), ÄúDecision-makers need information and implementation strategies on how to shift from a world of acute care solutions for chronic care needs to a world of chronic care solutions for chronic care needs,Äù28 this review will explore existing knowledge related to medication management from a safety perspective for older adults receiving home care as well as their caregivers, families and providers. Examining existing research related to the issues and challenges faced by this population, as well as any strategies used to mitigate or ameliorate safety risks, will illuminate gaps in current knowledge, identify priority research areas, and advance patient safety research in home care. The following explanations/definitions are relevant to the review: Homecare services personnel Ä¢ Homecare services are the provision of care by a licensed or unlicensed health care provider who is contracted with a home-care agency. Ä¢ Include any paid caregiver, (regulated or unregulated), with or without training, including personal support workers, home support workers, health care aides and lay health care workers. Homecare services Ä¢ Include services to address the treatment of any health condition but must specifically address medication management. Home-dwelling Ä¢ Home-dwelling includes people living at home, with friends or family, in retirement homes, seniorÄüs apartments, residential centers, or communal residences. This review will be a mixed method (quantitative and qualitative) scoping review to establish the state of knowledge on this topic in the current research literature. It is anticipated that the scoping review will provide an indication of areas to explore further and at greater depth using systematic review methodology. An initial search of the Joanna Briggs Institute Library and the Cochrane Library, Medline and CINAHL has been done and has determined that there are no previous reviews done on this topic."
Homework in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: A Systematic Review of Adherence Assessment in Anxiety and Depression (2011-2016)	"Treatment adherence has posed a substantial challenge not only for patients but also for the health profession for many decades. The last 5 years has witnessed significant attention toward adherence with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) homework for anxiety and depressive disorders, and adherence assessment methods have diversified. However, there remains a large component of the adherence process not assessed in CBT, with patient effort, engagement, and the known role for treatment appraisals and beliefs necessitating the pursuit of improved adherence assessment methods.

How can we increase physical activity and exercise among youth experiencing first-episode psychosis? A systematic review of intervention variables	"AIMS: To review intervention variables and outcomes of studies designed to increase physical activity or exercise participation among people experiencing first-episode psychosis. METHODS: A systematic review of electronic databases was conducted from inception to November 2014. RESULTS: Eleven eligible studies describing 12 interventions were included (n = 351; 14-35 years) incorporating health coaching (n = 5), exercise prescriptions based on physiological parameters (e.g. heart rate) (n = 3), supervised, individually tailored programmes (n = 2), an Internet-delivered intervention and a yoga intervention. The majority of the interventions were delivered over 12 weeks (n = 6) and in community settings (n = 11). Five studies assessed aerobic capacity (VO2 max or VO2 peak) and three studies assessed self-reported physical activity levels. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable heterogeneity in the design, implementation and assessment of interventions was found. There is an urgent need to better understand how physical activity can be increased in line with the internationally endorsed HeaL (Healthy Active Lives) Declaration 5-year physical activity target.

How do older people describe their sensory experiences of the natural world? A systematic review of the qualitative evidence	"Background: Despite the increased scholarly interest in the senses and sensory experiences, the topic of older people's sensory engagement with nature is currently under researched. This paper reviews and synthesises qualitative research evidence about how older people, including those living with dementia, describe their sensory engagement with the natural world.Methods: Ten databases were searched from 1990 to September 2014: MEDLINE (Ovid), MEDLINE-in-Process (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), GreenFILE (EBSCO), ProQuest Sociology, ASSIA (ProQuest), International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (ProQuest); HMIC (Ovid); Social Policy and Practice (Ovid). Forward and backward citation chasing of included articles was conducted; 20 organizations were contacted to identify unpublished reports. Screening was undertaken independently by two reviewers.Results: Twenty seven studies were included. Thematic analysis revealed that descriptions of sensory experiences are encompassed within six themes: descriptions from 'the window'; sensory descriptions that emphasise vision; descriptions of 'being in nature'; descriptions of 'doing in nature'; barriers to sensory engagement; and meanings of being and doing in nature.Conclusions: Older people derive considerable pleasure and enjoyment from viewing nature, being and doing in nature which, in turn has a positive impact on their wellbeing and quality of life. Future research could usefully explore how sensory engagement with nature could be used to stimulate reminiscences of places and people, and evoke past sensory experiences to enrich everyday life and maintain a sense of self. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO ( CRD42015020736 )."
How Does a Supervised Exercise Program Improve Quality of Life in Patients with Cancer? A Concept Mapping Study Examining Patients' Perspectives.	"Background: Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses demonstrated beneficial effects of exercise during or following cancer treatment on quality of life (QoL). Aiming to understand how exercise contributes to a patient's QoL, we examined patients' perspectives via a process called concept mapping. This unique method provides structure and objectivity to rich qualitative data."
How does feedback from patients impact upon healthcare student clinical skill development and learning? A systematic review	"BACKGROUND: A key feature of health professionals' training, irrespective of discipline, is the acquisition and application of clinical and communication skills. Despite this, little is known about the potential role of patient feedback on this process. This systematic review aimed to answer the question: How does feedback from patients impact upon healthcare student clinical skill development and learning? DESIGN: Systematic review of published literature. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for studies that explored the effects of patient feedback on student learning and were published before March 2016. Eligible articles underwent methodological evaluation using the McMaster University Critical Evaluation Forms and data extraction. RESULTS: A total of 237 articles were retrieved following searches of electronic databases and hand searches of reference lists. Twelve (7 quantitative, 2 qualitative, 3 mixed methods) studies met the inclusion criteria. Eleven studies reported that patient feedback improved students' clinical skills. CONCLUSION: Minimal research has explored the impact of patient feedback on student learning. The research to date suggests that direct feedback from patients may be beneficial for the development of students' communication and clinical skills; however, the wide variety of evaluation methods and the lack of validated tools for patients to provide feedback suggest that further exploration is warranted."
How does it work? Factors involved in telemedicine home-interventions effectiveness: A review of reviews	"INTRODUCTION: Definitive evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of telemedicine home-interventions for the management of chronic diseases is still lacking. This study examines whether and how published reviews consider and discuss the influence on outcomes of different factors, including: setting, target, and intensity of intervention; patient engagement; the perspective of patients, caregivers and health professionals; the organizational model; patient education and support. Included reviews were also assessed in terms of economic and ethical issues. METHODS: Two search algorithms were developed to scan PubMed for reviews published between 2000 and 2015, about ICT-based interventions for the management of hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or for the care of elderly patients. Based on our inclusion criteria, 25 reviews were selected for analysis. RESULTS: None of the included reviews covered all the above-mentioned factors. They mostly considered target (44%) and intervention intensity (24%). Setting, ethical issues, patient engagement, and caregiver perspective were the most neglected factors (considered in 0-4% of the reviews). Only 4 reviews (16%) considered at least 4 of the 11 factors, the maximum number of factors considered in a review is 5. CONCLUSIONS: Factors that may be involved in ICT-based interventions, affecting their effectiveness or cost-effectiveness, are not enough studied in the literature. This research suggests to consider mostly the role of each one, comparing not only disease-related outcomes, but also patients and healthcare organizations outcomes, and patient engagement, in order to understand how interventions work."
How effective are family-based and institutional nutrition interventions in improving children's diet and health? A systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Effective strategies to improve dietary intake in young children are a priority to reduce the high prevalence of chronic non-communicable diseases in adulthood. This study aimed to assess the impact of family-based and school/preschool nutrition programs on the health of children aged 12 or younger, including the sustainability of these impacts and the relevance to socio-economic inequalities. METHODS: A systematic review of literature published from 1980 to December 2014 was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials involving families with children aged up to 12 years in high income countries were included. The primary outcomes were dietary intake and health status. Results were presented in a narrative synthesis due to the heterogeneity of the interventions and outcomes. RESULTS: The systematic search and assessment identified 39 eligible studies. 82% of these studies were set in school/preschools. Only one school study assessed the impact of involving parents systematically. The family-based programs which provided simple positive dietary advice to parents and regular follow-up reduced fat intake significantly. School and family-based studies, if designed and implemented well, increased F&V intake, particularly fruit. Effective school-based programs have incorporated role-models including peers, teachers and heroic figures, rewards and increased access to healthy foods. School nutrition programs in disadvantaged communities were as effective as programs in other communities. CONCLUSIONS: Family and school nutrition programs can improve dietary intake, however evidence of the long-term sustainability of these impacts is limited. The modest overall impact of even these successful programs suggest complementary nutrition interventions are needed to build a supportive environment for healthy eating generally."
How empathic is your healthcare practitioner? A systematic review and meta-analysis of patient surveys	"BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence suggests that healthcare practitioners who enhance how they express empathy can improve patient health, and reduce medico-legal risk. However we do not know how consistently healthcare practitioners express adequate empathy. In this study, we addressed this gap by investigating patient rankings of practitioner empathy. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that asked patients to rate their practitioners' empathy using the Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) measure. CARE is emerging as the most common and best-validated patient rating of practitioner empathy. We searched: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cinahl, Science & Social Science Citation Indexes, the Cochrane Library and PubMed from database inception to March 2016. We excluded studies that did not use the CARE measure. Two reviewers independently screened titles and extracted data on average CARE scores, demographic data for patients and practitioners, and type of healthcare practitioners. RESULTS: Sixty-four independent studies within 51 publications had sufficient data to pool. The average CARE score was 40.48 (95% CI, 39.24 to 41.72). This rank s in the bottom 5th percentile in comparison with scores collected by CARE developers. Longer consultations (n = 13) scored 15% higher (42.60, 95% CI 40.66 to 44.54) than shorter (n = 9) consultations (34.93, 95% CI 32.63 to 37.24). Studies with mostly (>50%) female practitioners (n = 6) showed 16% higher empathy scores (42.77, 95% CI 38.98 to 46.56) than those with mostly (>50%) male (n = 6) practitioners (34.84, 95% CI 30.98 to 38.71). There were statistically significant (P = 0.032) differences between types of providers (allied health professionals, medical students, physicians, and traditional Chinese doctors). Allied Health Professionals (n = 6) scored the highest (45.29, 95% CI 41.38 to 49.20), and physicians (n = 39) scored the lowest (39.68, 95% CI 38.29 to 41.08). Patients in Australia, the USA, and the UK reported highest empathy ratings (>43 average CARE), with lowest scores (<35 average CARE scores) in Hong Kong. CONCLUSIONS: Patient rankings of practitioner empathy are highly variable, with female practitioners expressing empathy to patients more effectively than male practitioners. The high variability of patient rating of practitioner empathy is likely to be associated with variable patient health outcomes. Limitations included frequent failure to report response rates introducing a risk of response bias. Future work is warranted to investigate ways to reduce the variability in practitioner empathy."
How equitable are community health worker programmes and which programme features influence equity of community health worker services? a systematic review	"Background: Community health workers (CHWs) are uniquely placed to link communities with the health system, playing a role in improving the reach of health systems and bringing health services closer to hard-to-reach and marginalised groups. A systematic review was conducted to determine the extent of equity of CHW programmes and to identify intervention design factors which influence equity of health outcomes. Methods: In accordance with our published protocol, we systematically searched eight databases from 2004 to 2014 for quantitative and qualitative studies which assessed access, utilisation, quality or community empowerment following introduction of a CHW programme according to equity stratifiers (place of residence, gender, socio-economic position and disability). Thirty four papers met inclusion criteria. A thematic framework was applied and data extracted and managed, prior to charting and thematic analysis. Results: To our knowledge this is the first systematic review that describes the extent of equity within CHW programmes and identifies CHW intervention design features which influence equity. CHW programmes were found to promote equity of access and utilisation for community health by reducing inequities relating to place of residence, gender, education and socio-economic position. CHWs can also contribute towards more equitable uptake of referrals at health facility level. There was no clear evidence for equitable quality of services provided by CHWs and limited information regarding the role of the CHW in generating community empowerment to respond to social determinants of health. Factors promoting greater equity of CHW services include recruitment of most poor community members as CHWs, close proximity of services to households, pre-existing social relationship with CHW, provision of home-based services, free service delivery, targeting of poor households, strengthened referral to facility, sensitisation and mobilisation of community. However, if CHW programmes are not well planned some of the barriers faced by clients at health facility level can replicate at community level. Conclusions: CHWs promote equitable access to health promotion, disease prevention and use of curative services at household level. However, care must be taken by policymakers and implementers to take into account factors which can influence the equity of services during planning and implementation of CHW programmes."
How family caregivers of cancer patients manage symptoms at home: A systematic review.	"INTRODUCTION: Cancer affects not only the patient, but also the whole family, especially when a member of the family assumes the role of the family caregiver. This puts an additional emotional, social and financial strain on the family caregivers. Family caregivers of cancer patients are actively involved in the care provided at the home setting through various ways including practical tasks, symptom management and care coordination. The focus of preceding studies on family caregivers and symptom management was either on pain or the patients' and family caregivers' experience of symptom management and coping. The aim of this review was to provide evidence on how family caregivers manage symptoms and side effects at home, in adult cancer patients throughout the disease trajectory. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed in PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials with a combination of keywords and MeSH terms for family caregivers, cancer, symptoms, side effects and management. Based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 1270 articles were screened and 20 studies were included in the analysis. A descriptive analysis was performed due to the heterogeneity of the findings. RESULTS: The results showed that only a limited number of studies (3/20) explored how and what family caregivers do in symptom management as a primary outcome. Family caregivers provided psychosocial support, such as supporting and motivating the patient and maintaining social engagement. Caregivers provided physical support such as with the administration of medicine and tube feeding. As an integral part of managing the symptoms, family caregivers actively monitored and assessed symptoms to timely recognize any treatment related side effects, assess the response to therapeutic interventions and recognize possible deterioration in physical status. Furthermore, family caregivers were often the decision maker - being alert, watching and waiting and decided when to act and when not to act. CONCLUSIONS: Family caregivers are doing work similar to healthcare professionals, when managing symptoms and side effects at home in patients with cancer. Advanced tasks such as assessing, monitoring and deciding when and how to act are included in the daily routine of family caregivers. Copyright ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"How Marginalized Young People Access, Engage With, and Navigate Health-Care Systems in the Digital Age: Systematic Review"	"PURPOSE: This systematic review examines how marginalized young people access and engage with health services and navigate health-care systems in high-income countries. METHODS: Medline, CINAHL, PsychInfo, The University of Sydney Library database, and Google Scholar were searched to identify qualitative and quantitative original research, published from 2006 to 2017, that focused on selected definitions of marginalized young people (12 to 24 years), their parents/carers, and/or health professionals working with these populations. A thematic synthesis was undertaken identifying themes across and between groups on barriers and/or facilitators to access, engagement, and/or navigation of health-care systems. RESULTS: Of 1,796 articles identified, 68 studies in the final selection focused on marginalized young people who were homeless (n = 20), living in rural areas (n = 14), of refugee background (n = 11), gender and/or sexuality diverse (n = 11), indigenous (n = 4), low income (n = 4), young offenders (n = 2), or living with a disability (n = 2). Studies were from the United States, Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Portugal, including 44 qualitative, 16 quantitative, and 8 mixed-method study types. Sample sizes ranged from 3 to 1,388. Eight themes were identified relating to ability to recognize and understand health issues; service knowledge and attitudes toward help seeking; structural barriers; professionals' knowledge, skills, attitudes; service environments and structures; ability to navigate the health system; youth participation; and technology opportunities. CONCLUSIONS: Marginalized young people experience barriers in addition to those common to all young people. Future studies should consider the role of technology in access, engagement, and health system navigation, and the impact of intersectionality between marginalized groups.

How outcomes are achieved through patient portals: a realist review	"OBJECTIVE: To examine how patient portals contribute to health service delivery and patient outcomes. The specific aims were to examine how outcomes are produced, and how variations in outcomes can be explained. METHODS: We used a realist review method, which aims to describe how 'an intervention works, for whom, and in what circumstances' by analyzing patterns between context, mechanism, and outcomes. We reviewed 32 evaluation studies of patient portals published since 2003. RESULTS: The reviewed evaluations indicate that as a complement to existing health services, patient portals can lead to improvements in clinical outcomes, patient behavior, and experiences. Four different mechanisms are reported to yield the reported outcome improvements. These are patient insight into personal health information, activation of information, interpersonal continuity of care, and service convenience. The vast majority of evaluations were conducted in integrated health service networks in the USA, and we detected no substantial variation in outcomes across these networks. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Patient portals may impact clinical outcomes and health service delivery through multiple mechanisms. Given the relative uniformity of evaluation contexts, we were not able to detect patterns in how patient portals work in different contexts. Nonetheless, it appears from the overwhelming proportion of patient portal evaluations coming from integrated health service networks, that these networks provide more fertile contexts for patient portals to be effective. To improve the understanding of how patient portals work, future evaluations of patient portals should capture information about mechanisms and context that influence their outcomes.

How sedentary are people with psychosis? A systematic review and meta-analysis	"OBJECTIVE: Sedentary behavior (SB) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate SB levels and predictors in people with psychosis. METHOD: Major electronic databases were searched from inception till 09/2015 for articles measuring SB with a self-report questionnaire (SRQ) or objective measure (e.g. accelerometer) in people with psychosis, including schizophrenia spectrum and bipolar disorders. A random effects meta-analysis and meta regression analysis were conducted. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were eligible including 2033 people with psychosis (mean age 41.3years (range 25.1-60), 63.2% male (range 35-89%), body mass index 28.7 (range 25.9-32.1). The trim and fill analysis demonstrated people with psychosis spent 660.8min (95% CI 523.2-798.4, participants=2033) or 11.0h (95% CI 8.72-13.3) per day being sedentary. Objective measures of SB recorded significantly higher levels (p<0.001) of SB (12.6h per day, 95% CI 8.97-16.2, studies=7, participants=254) compared to self-report SB (6.85h per day, 95% CI 4.75-8.96, studies=6, participants=1779). People with psychosis engaged in significantly more SB than controls (g=1.13, 95% CI 0.496-1.77, P<0.001, n psychosis=216, n controls=159) equating to a mean difference of 2.80 (95% CI 1.47-4.1) hours per day. Multivariate meta-regression confirmed that objective measurement of SB predicted higher levels of sedentariness. CONCLUSIONS: People with psychosis engage in very high levels of sedentary behavior in their waking day and current SRQ may underestimate SB. Given that SB is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease, future interventions specifically targeting the prevention of SB are warranted. Copyright ¬© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

How to measure quality of life for cost-effectiveness analyses of personality disorders: a systematic review	"A systematic review was undertaken to assess the construct validity and responsiveness of four generic health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures in personality disorders (PDs). Ten databases were searched and reference lists scrutinized to identify relevant studies. Relevant data were extracted accordingly. A narrative synthesis was performed of the evidence on construct validity, including known groups validity (detecting differences in HRQL scores between two different groups), convergent validity (strength of association between generic HRQL), and other measures (e.g., symptom) and responsiveness (differences in generic HRQL measure scores in responders/nonresponders or correlation with changes in other measures). Ten studies were identified: six of the EQ-5D, two involving the SF-36, and another two the SF-12, but none with the SF-6D. Evidence indicated that the EQ-5D, SF-36, and SF-12 were probably valid measures with PDs. Four studies demonstrated that the EQ-5D Index was able to detect changes in patients. The authors conclude that generic HRQL measures appear appropriate for use with people with PDs in terms of psychometric performance. However, qualitative concerns remain as to whether they fully reflect the impact of the condition."
How to reduce parental provision of unhealthy foods to 3- to 8-year-old children in the home environment? A systematic review utilizing the Behaviour Change Wheel framework.	"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of obesity prevention interventions to improve children's diet can be enhanced. Deconstructing past interventions can identify components with potential to change behaviour. This systematic review using the Behaviour Change Wheel aimed to examine the behaviour change content of interventions supporting parents of 3- to 8-year olds to reduce provision of unhealthy foods to children. METHODS: Ebscohost, Ovid, Scopus and Web of Science were searched. Eligible studies included controlled interventions with active parent involvement, at least one intervention strategy and outcome measure for unhealthy foods >=3 months from baseline. Seventeen interventions were included describing 18 intervention arms. RESULTS: Interventions frequently targeted parents' reflective motivation (n = 17) and psychological capability (n = 15), through education (n = 15) or enablement (n = 15) intervention functions and service provision (n = 18) policy category. Only 24 of the 93 behaviour change techniques were used with an average of five techniques used per intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Existing interventions achieving small reductions in unhealthy food intake are homogenous in approach. There is potential to utilize untapped behaviour change techniques, through comprehensive intervention design and behavioural analysis guided by the Behaviour Change Wheel. Interventions targeting opportunity through persuasion, modelling or environmental restructuring, and using different policy categories are urgently needed to provide an evidence base to inform policy and practice.

Human Factors and Data Logging Processes With the Use of Advanced Technology for Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: Systematic Integrative Review	"BACKGROUND: People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) undertake self-management to prevent short and long-term complications. Advanced technology potentially supports such activities but requires consideration of psychological and behavioral constructs and usability issues. Economic factors and health care provider capacity influence access and uptake of advanced technology. Previous reviews have focused upon clinical outcomes or were descriptive or have synthesized studies on adults with those on children and young people where human factors are different. OBJECTIVE: This review described and examined the relationship between human factors and adherence with technology for data logging processes in adults with T1D. METHODS: A systematic literature search was undertaken by using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Quality appraisal was undertaken and data were abstracted and categorized into the themes that underpinned the human factor constructs that were examined. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies were included. A total of 6 constructs emerged from the data analysis: the relationship between adherence to data logging and measurable outcomes; satisfaction with the transition to advanced technology for self-management; use of advanced technology and time spent on diabetes-related activities; strategies to mediate the complexities of diabetes and the use of advanced technology; cognition in the wild; and meanings, views, and perspectives from the users of technology. CONCLUSIONS: Increased treatment satisfaction was found on transition from traditional to advanced technology use-insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM); the most significant factor was when blood glucose levels were consistently <7.00 mmol/L (P <=.01). Participants spent considerable time on their diabetes self-care. Logging of data was positively correlated with increasing age when using an app that provided meaningful feedback (regression coefficient=55.8 recordings/year; P <=.01). There were benefits of CGM for older people in mediating complexities and fears of hypoglycemia with significant differences in well-being (P <=.001). Qualitative studies explored the contextual use and uptake of technology. The results suggested frustrations with CGM, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, calibration of devices, and alarms. Furthermore implications for ""body image"" and the way in which ""significant others"" impacted on the behavior and attitude of the individual toward technology use. There were wide variations in the normal use of and interaction with technology across a continuum of sociocultural contexts, which has implications for the way in which future technologies should be designed. Quantitative studies were limited by small sample sizes, making it difficult to generalize findings to other contexts. This was further limited by a sample that was predominantly white, well-controlled, and engaged with self-care. The use of critical appraisal frameworks demonstrated where research into human factors and data logging processes of individuals could be improved. This included engaging people in the design of the technology, especially hard-to-reach or marginalized groups. Copyright ¬©Marion Waite, Clare Martin, Rachel Franklin, David Duce, Rachel Harrison.

"Hydration and nutrition at the end of life: a systematic review of emotional impact, perceptions, and decision-making among patients, family, and health care staff"	"BACKGROUND: Decrease in oral intake, weight loss, and muscular weakness in the last phases of a terminal illness, particularly in the context of the cachexia-anorexia syndrome, can be an important source of anxiety for the triad of patient, family, and health staff. METHODS: The present literature review examines the emotional impact of reduced oral intake as well as perceptions and attitudes toward assisted nutrition and hydration for terminally ill patients(1) at the end of life, among patients, family, and health care staff. We have identified the ways in which emotional and cultural factors influence decision-making about assisted nutrition and hydration. RESULTS: Lack of information and misperceptions of medically assisted nutrition and hydration can play a predominant role in the decision to begin or suspend nutritional or hydration support. CONCLUSIONS: Our literature review reveals that these social, emotional, and clinical misperception elements should be considered in the decision-making processes to help the triad develop functional forms of care at this final stage of life.

"Identifying stakeholder opinion regarding access to ""high-cost medicines"": A systematic review of the literature."	"Objective: To identify the viewpoints and perceptions of different stakeholders regarding high cost medicines (HCMs). Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify original research articles. Using predefined categories, data related to the viewpoints of different stakeholders was systematically extracted and analyzed. Results: Thirty seven original research articles matched the criteria. The main stakeholders identified include physicians, patients, public and health funding authorities. The influence of media and other economic and ethical issues were also identified in the literature. A large number of stakeholders were concerned about lack of access to HCMs. Physicians have difficulty balancing the the rational use of expensive drugs while at the same time acting as ""patients' advocate"". Patients would like to know about all treatment options, even if they may not be able to afford them. The process and criteria for reimbursement should be transparent and access has to be equitable across patient groups. Conclusion: Access to HCMs could be improved through transparency and involvement of all stakeholders, especially patients and the public. Moral issues and the ""rule of rescue"" could influence decision-making process significantly. At system level, objectivity is important to ensure that the system is equitable and transparent. ¬© 2014 Versita and Springer-Verlag."
"Impact of community-based interventions on HIV knowledge, attitudes, and transmission."	"In 2012, an estimated 35.3 million people lived with HIV, while approximately two million new HIV infections were reported. Community-based interventions (CBIs) for the prevention and control of HIV allow increased access and ease availability of medical care to population at risk, or already infected with, HIV. This paper evaluates the impact of CBIs on HIV knowledge, attitudes, and transmission. We included 39 studies on educational activities, counseling sessions, home visits, mentoring, women's groups, peer leadership, and street outreach activities in community settings that aimed to increase awareness on HIV/AIDS risk factors and ensure treatment adherence. Our review findings suggest that CBIs to increase HIV awareness and risk reduction are effective in improving knowledge, attitudes, and practice outcomes as evidenced by the increased knowledge scores for HIV/AIDS (SMD: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.25, 1.07), protected sexual encounters (RR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.25), condom use (SMD: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.03, 1.58), and decreased frequency of sexual intercourse (RR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.61, 0.96). Analysis shows that CBIs did not have any significant impact on scores for self-efficacy and communication. We found very limited evidence on community-based management for HIV infected population and prevention of mother- to-child transmission (MTCT) for HIV-infected pregnant women. Qualitative synthesis suggests that establishment of community support at the onset of HIV prevention programs leads to community acceptance and engagement. School-based delivery of HIV prevention education and contraceptive distribution have also been advocated as potential strategies to target high-risk youth group. Future studies should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of community delivery platforms for prevention of MTCT, and various emerging models of care to improve morbidity and mortality outcomes."
"Impact of computer-mediated, obesity-related nutrition education interventions for adolescents: a systematic review"	"PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate recent research regarding the use of computer-based nutrition education interventions targeting adolescent overweight and obesity. METHODS: Online databases were systematically searched using key words, and bibliographies of related articles were manually searched. Inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied and included studies evaluated for their ability to achieve their objectives and for quality using the Nutrition Evidence Library appraisal guidelines for research design and implementation. RESULTS: Of the 15 studies included, 10 were randomized controlled trials. Two studies targeted weight loss, 2 targeted weight maintenance, and 11 targeted dietary improvement with or without physical activity. At least half of in-school (60%) and nonschool interventions (80%) exhibited significantly positive effects on nutrition- or obesity-related variables. Small changes in diet, physical activity, knowledge, and self-efficacy were shown; however, few results were sustained long term. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations included application of health behavior theory and computer tailoring for feedback messages. Future research should include thorough description of intervention content (messages, theory, multimedia, etc.), application of rigorous methodology, as well as consideration of covariates such as parental involvement and gender. With further research and evidentiary support, this approach to obesity-related nutrition education has the potential to be successful. Copyright ¬© 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

"Impact of GP gatekeeping on quality of care, and health outcomes, use, and expenditure: a systematic review."	"BACKGROUND: GPs often act as gatekeepers, authorising patients' access to specialty care. Gatekeeping is frequently perceived as lowering health service use and health expenditure. However, there is little evidence suggesting that gatekeeping is more beneficial than direct access in terms of patient- and health-related outcomes. AIM: To establish the impact of GP gatekeeping on quality of care, health use and expenditure, and health outcomes and patient satisfaction. DESIGN AND SETTING: A systematic review. METHOD: The databases MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant articles using a search strategy. Two authors independently screened search results and assessed the quality of studies. RESULTS: Electronic searches identified 4899 studies (after removing duplicates), of which 25 met the inclusion criteria. Gatekeeping was associated with better quality of care and appropriate referral for further hospital visits and investigation. However, one study reported unfavourable outcomes for patients with cancer under gatekeeping, and some concerns were raised about the accuracy of diagnoses made by gatekeepers. Gatekeeping resulted in fewer hospitalisations and use of specialist care, but inevitably was associated with more primary care visits. Patients were less satisfied with gatekeeping than direct-access systems. CONCLUSION: Gatekeeping was associated with lower healthcare use and expenditure, and better quality of care, but with lower patient satisfaction. Survival rate of patients with cancer in gatekeeping schemes was significantly lower than those in direct access, although primary care gatekeeping was not otherwise associated with delayed patient referral. The long-term outcomes of gatekeeping arrangements should be carefully studied before devising new gatekeeping policies. Copyright ¬© British Journal of General Practice 2019."
Impact of Medication Reviews Delivered by Community Pharmacist to Elderly Patients on Polypharmacy: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.	"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the impact of medication reviews delivered by community pharmacists to elderly patients on polypharmacy. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in four bibliographic databases/search engine (PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and IPA) and three gray literature sources (OpenGrey, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Digital Access to Research Theses - Europe) from inception to January 2018. Randomized controlled trials were selected if they met the following criteria: (a) studied in patients 65 years or older who were taking four or more prescribed medications; (b) the ""test"" interventions were delivered by community pharmacists; and (c) measured one of these following outcomes: hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visit, quality of life, or adherence. Quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Group risk of bias tool. Random-effects model meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of the 3634 articles screened, four studies with a total of 4633 participants were included. The intervention provided in all included studies was clinical medication review. Three studies were at low risk of bias, and the remaining study had unclear risk of bias. When compared with usual care, medication reviews provided by community pharmacist significantly reduced risk of ED visits (risk ratio = 0.68; 95% confidence interval = 0.48-0.96). There was also a tendency that pharmacist interventions decreased risk of hospitalizations (risk ratio = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.78-1.00), although no statistical significant. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence demonstrates that clinical medication reviews for older people with polypharmacy reduces the risk of ED visits. Medication reviews can be considered as another area where community pharmacists can contribute to improve patient safety."
Impact of Parent-Targeted eHealth on Parent and Infant Health Outcomes: A Scoping Review	"Improved communication, education, and parental involvement in infant care have been demonstrated to enhance parental well-being and neonatal health outcomes. eHealth has the potential to increase parental presence in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). There has been no synthesized review on the direct impact of eHealth use on parental and neonatal health outcomes. The aim of this scoping review is to explore eHealth utilization by families of high-risk newborn infants in the NICU and/or postdischarge on health outcomes. PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched from 1980 to October 2015 using key terms for ""neonatal,"" ""parents,"" ""eHealth,"" and ""patient education."" Criteria of peer-reviewed empirical studies published in English, targeting parents of NICU infants regardless of diagnosis, and eHealth utilization during NICU stay or postdischarge yielded 2218 studies. Extracted data were synthesized using thematic content analysis. Ten studies met inclusion, and 5 themes emerged: usability and feasibility, parental perceived benefits, infant's hospital length of stay, knowledge uptake, and predictors of variations in use. eHealth utilization was found to be desired by parents and promotes positive change in parental experience in the NICU. Actual and perceived benefits of eHealth for parents included ease of use, higher confidence in infant care, satisfaction, and knowledge uptake."
Impact of patient-centered discharge tools: A systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Patient-centered discharge tools provide an opportunity to engage patients, enhance patient understanding, and improve capacity for self-care and postdischarge outcomes. PURPOSE: To review studies that engaged patients in the design or delivery of discharge instruction tools and that tested their effect among hospitalized patients. DATA SOURCES: We conducted a search of 12 databases and journals from January 1994 through May 2014, and references of retrieved studies. STUDY SELECTION: English-language studies that tested discharge tools meant to engage patients were selected. Studies that measured outcomes after 3 months or without a control group or period were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent reviewers assessed the full-text papers and extracted data on features of patient engagement. DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty articles met inclusion criteria, 28 of which examined educational tools. Of these, 13 articles involved patients in content creation or tool delivery, with only 6 studies involving patients in both. While many of these studies (10 studies) demonstrated an improvement in patient comprehension, few studies found improvement in patient adherence despite their engagement. A few studies demonstrated an improvement in self-efficacy (2 studies) and a reduction in unplanned visits (3 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Improving patient engagement through the use of media, visual aids, or by involving patients when creating or delivering a discharge tool improves comprehension. However, further studies are needed to clarify the effect on patient experience, adherence, and healthcare utilization postdischarge. Better characterization of the level of patient engagement when designing discharge tools is needed given the heterogeneity found in current studies. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2017;12:110-117.

"Impact of social norms and social support on diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviour of adolescents: a scoping review"	"The prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in adulthood is rapidly increasing, and it is essential that risk factors for NCDs be addressed in adolescence, both for the health of individuals during adolescence and for their health in later life. These risk factors include diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. No literature has been published that comprehensively summarizes the impact of social norms and social support on these behaviours among adolescents. Therefore, a scoping review was conducted to determine the extent of recent (since 2000) literature available on this topic. A comprehensive search strategy was used to search PubMed and EMBASE for eligible reviews. Review papers (narrative reviews, systematic and non-systematic reviews) published in English in peer-reviewed journals from 2000 to February 2013 were included in the overview. Two of the authors screened the titles and abstracts of the search results independently. Thirty reviews were included in the scoping review. This scoping review has shown sufficient evidence for parental influences, and especially the positive impact of an authoritative parenting style, on healthy behaviours of adolescents, although the evidence is somewhat more compelling for diet than for physical activity and sedentary behaviour. More research is needed to investigate parental and family influences on physical activity and sedentary behaviour. And the effect of peer influences on diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviour of adolescents requires further investigation. The evidence presented affirms the consideration of social norms and social support in the development of interventions to address these behaviours in adolescents. The evidence regarding parenting style provides some concrete guidance for such interventions. Copyright ¬© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
Impact of sociodemographic patient characteristics on the efficacy of decision AIDS: a patient-level meta-analysis of 7 randomized trials.	"BACKGROUND: Decision aids (DAs) increase patient knowledge, reduce decisional conflict, and promote shared decision making (SDM). The extent to which they do so across diverse sociodemographic patient groups is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a patient-level meta-analysis of 7 randomized trials of DA versus usual care comprising 771 encounters between patients and clinicians discussing treatment options for chest pain, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, and osteoporosis. Using a random effects model, we examined the impact of sociodemographic patient characteristics (age, sex, education, income, and insurance status) on the outcomes of knowledge transfer, decisional conflict, and patient involvement in SDM. Because of small numbers of people of color in the study population, we were not powered to investigate the role of race. Most patients were aged >=65 years (61%), white (94%), and women (59%); two thirds had greater than a high school education. Compared with usual care, DA patients gained knowledge, were more likely to know their risk, and had less decisional conflict along with greater involvement in SDM. These gains were largely consistent across sociodemographic patient groups, with DAs demonstrating similar efficacy when used with vulnerable patients such as the elderly and those with less income and less formal education. Differences in efficacy were found only in knowledge of risk in 1 subgroup, with greater efficacy among those with higher education (35% versus 18%; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In this patient-level meta-analysis of 7 randomized trials, DAs were efficacious across diverse sociodemographic groups as measured by knowledge transfer, decisional conflict, and patient involvement in SDM. To the extent that DAs increase patient knowledge and participation in SDM, they have potential to impact health disparities related to these factors.

Impact of technology-based interventions for children and young people with type 1 diabetes on key diabetes self-management behaviours and prerequisites: A systematic review.	"Background: The role of technology in the self-management of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) among children and young people is not well understood. Interventions should aim to improve key diabetes self-management behaviours (self-management of blood glucose, insulin administration, physical activity and dietary behaviours) and prerequisites (psychological outcomes and HbA1c) highlighted in the UK guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for management of T1DM. The purpose was to identify evidence to assess the effectiveness of technological tools in promoting aspects of these guidelines amongst children and young people."
Impacts of continuous quality improvement in Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander primary health care in Australia	"Purpose Continuous quality improvement (CQI) programmes have been taken up widely by indigenous primary health care services in Australia, but as yet there has not been a systematic assessment of their focus and achievements. A scoping review of the literature from studies of CQI in indigenous primary health care services was undertaken to explore impacts on service systems, care and client outcomes with the aim of providing guidance on future evaluation efforts. The paper aims to discuss these issues, Design/methodology/approach Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to December 2016 and handsearching of key websites and publications. Studies of CQI programs or activities in Indigenous primary health care services which demonstrated some combination of CQI characteristics, as described by Rubenstein (2013) were included. A two-stage approach to analysis was undertaken. Stage 1 identified the range and scope of literature, and Stage 2 investigated impacts to service systems, care and client outcomes. The Framework for Performance Assessment in Primary Health Care was used to frame the Stage 2 analysis. Findings The majority of Aboriginal community controlled health services have been involved in CQI but there are gaps in knowledge about uptake in general practice and government clinics. There are as many baseline studies as studies on impacts over time. Of the 14 studies included for further analysis, 6 reported on impacts on service systems; all 14 reported on impacts on care and 6 on client outcomes. Changes to services systems are variable and studies of impacts on care and client outcomes show promising though uneven improvements. There are no economic studies or studies addressing community engagement in CQI activities. Research limitations/implications To supplement existing limited knowledge about which service system change strategies are effective and sustainable for which problems in which settings, there needs to be investment in research and development. Research needs to be grounded in the realities of service delivery and contribute to the development of CQI capacity at the service level. Knowledge translation needs to be built into implementation to ensure maximum benefit to those endeavouring on a daily basis to constantly reflect on and improve the quality of the care they deliver to clients, and to the stewardship structures supporting services at regional, state/territory and national levels. Practical implications Improved approaches, methods, data capture and reporting arrangements are needed to enhance existing activity and to ensure maximum benefit to services endeavouring to reflect on and improve quality of care and to the stewardship structure supporting services at regional, state/territory and national levels. Originality/value Although there is a growing body of research evidence about CQI both nationally and internationally, and considerable investment by the federal government in Australia to support CQI as part of routine practice, there has not been a systematic assessment of the achievements of CQI in Indigenous primary health care services. Many unanswered questions remain about the extent of uptake, implementation and impacts. This is a barrier to future investment and regional and local programme design, monitoring and evaluation. The authors conducted a scoping review to address these questions. From this, the authors draw conclusions about the state of knowledge in Australia with a view to informing how future CQI research and evaluation might be intensified."
Implementation of intersectoral community approaches targeting childhood obesity: a systematic review	"The implementation of intersectoral community approaches targeting childhood obesity (IACO) is considered challenging. To help overcome these challenges, an overview of the evidence to date is needed. We searched four databases to identify papers that reported on the determinants of successful implementation of IACOs, resulting in the inclusion of 25 studies. We appraised study quality with the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool and the Quality Framework; reported implementation outcome indicators were reviewed via narrative synthesis. Quality of included studies varied. The most frequently reported indicators of implementation success were fidelity and coverage. Determinants related to the social-political context and the organization were most often cited as influencing implementation, in particular, 'collaboration between community partners', 'the availability of (human) resources' and 'time available for implementation'. The association between determinants and implementation variability was never explicated. We conclude that although some insights into the effective implementation of IACOs are present, more research is needed. Emphasis should be placed on elucidating the relationship between determinants and implementation success. Research should further focus on developing a 'golden standard' for evaluating and reporting on implementation research. These actions will improve the comparison of study outcomes and may constitute the cumulative development of knowledge about the conditions for designing evidence-based implementation strategies.

Implementation of treatment guidelines for specialist mental health care.	"Background A huge gap exists between the production of evidence and its uptake in clinical practice settings. To fill this gap, treatment guidelines, based on explicit assessments of the evidence base, are commonly used in several fields of psychiatry, including schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. However, it remains unclear whether treatment guidelines have any material impact on provider performance and patient outcomes, and how implementation should be conducted to maximise benefit. Objectives The primary objective of this review was to examine the efficacy of guideline implementation strategies in improving process outcomes (performance of healthcare providers) and patient outcomes. We also explored which components of different guideline implementation strategies could influence them. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (March 2012 and August 2015), as well as references of included studies. Selection criteria Studies that examined schizophrenia-spectrum disorders to compare guideline implementation strategies with usual care or to assess the comparative efficacy of different guideline implementation strategies. Data collection and analysis Review authors worked independently and in duplicate to critically appraise records from 990 studies; six individual studies met the inclusion criteria. Among the six included studies, significant heterogeneity was found in the focus of the guideline, target of the intervention, implementation strategy, and outcome measures, so meta-analysis was carried out for antipsychotic co-prescribing only. Main results This review now includes six studies, with a total of 1727 participants. Of the six included studies, practitioner impact was assessed in four. Overall, risk of bias was rated as low or unclear, and all evidence in the 'Summary of findings' tables was graded as low or very low quality. Meta-analysis revealed that a combination of several guideline dissemination and implementation strategies targeting healthcare professionals did not reduce antipsychotic co-prescribing in schizophrenia outpatients (2 RCTs, N = 1082, RR 1.10 CI 0.99 to 1.23; corrected for cluster design: N = 310, RR 0.97, CI 0.75 to 1.25, very low-quality evidence). One trial, which studied a nurse-led intervention aimed at promoting cardiovascular disease screening, found a significant effect in the proportion of people receiving screening (Framingham score: N = 110, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.87), although in the analysis corrected for cluster design, the effect was no longer statistically significant (N = 38, RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.03, very low-quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Considering the available evidence, it is not possible to arrive at definitive conclusions. The preliminary pattern of evidence suggests that uncertainty remains about clinically meaningful and sustainable effects of treatment guidelines on patient outcomes and how best to implement such guidelines for maximal benefit."
Implementing action research in hospital settings: a systematic review	"PURPOSE: Health care organizations and hospitals in particular are highly resistant to change. The reasons for this are rooted in professional role behaviors, hierarchical structures and the influence of hidden curricula that inform organizational culture. Action research (AR) has been identified as a promising bottom-up approach that has the potential to address the significant barriers to change. However, to date no systematic review of the field in health care exists. The paper aims to discuss these issues. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A systematic review of the literature was conducted. Studies were reviewed with regard to the four stages of AR; problem identification, planning, implementation and evaluation. FINDINGS: Only 19 studies were identified that fit the inclusion criteria. Results revealed significant heterogeneity with regard to theoretical background, methodology employed and evaluation methods used. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Only studies published and written in the English language were included. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The field of AR interventions would benefit from a theoretical framework that has the ability to guide the methodology and evaluation processes. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This is the first systematic review of AR in hospitals."
Implementing community-based cervical cancer screening programs using visual inspection with acetic acid in India: A systematic review	"The objective of this review was to systematically appraise the existing published literature about community-based cervical cancer screening programs that have used visual inspection methods using acetic acid (VIA) in India. All peer reviewed journal articles till December 2015 were searched per PRISMA guidelines. Articles reporting results from cervical cancer screening programs in community-based settings, conducted in India, and using VIA were included in this review. The search resulted in 20 articles to be included in the review with a total of 313,553 women at 12 unique urban and rural sites across India. Seventeen (85%) studies were cross-sectional and three studies were randomized controlled trials; most studies compared accuracy of VIA with other screening tests such as visual inspection using Lugol's Iodine (VILI), HPV DNA, and cytology. Of studies that reported test accuracy for CIN Grade 2+, the VIA sensitivity values ranged from 16.6-82.6% and specificity ranged from 82.1-96.8%. Women between age groups of 30-59 years were recruited using motivational one-on-one counseling and local support staff. All studies conducted diagnostic follow-up using colposcopy and guided biopsies, when necessary. Three major themes were identified that facilitated implementation of screening programs in a community-based setting: standardized training that maintained competency of test providers; collaborations with community-based organizations that used health education for recruitment of participants; and employing the screen-and-treat method to reduce loss to follow-up. Summarized evidence presented in this review could substantially influence future implementation and sustainment of cervical cancer screening programs at a national level.

Implementing exercise programs to prevent falls: systematic descriptive review	"BACKGROUND: The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends exercise to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults aged >= 65 years at increased fall risk. However, little is known about how best to implement exercise programs in routine care when a patient's need for exercise is identified within the healthcare system. METHODS: Using a qualitative approach, we reviewed the literature to determine how exercise programs to prevent falls are implemented from the vantage point of a health care setting. We synthesized descriptive information about each program with data on program features and implementation difficulties and facilitators. RESULTS: We found that programs sponsored by primary care providers (PCPs) or specialists may help with recruitment into exercise programs. PCPs have the opportunity to identify people at risk and promote participation since most older adults regularly visit, and inquire about exercise from, their physicians. In terms of referral options, both home-based and group-based exercise programs have been shown effective in preventing falls; however, each approach carries strengths and limitations. Home-based programs can include participants who are reluctant or unable to attend group classes and can be individually tailored, but provide less opportunity for supervision and socialization than classes. Adherence to programs can be encouraged, and attrition minimized, through positive reinforcement. Successful programs ranged in expense for exercise sessions: a weekly class combined with exercises at home cost $100 per participant per week. CONCLUSIONS: With increasing attention to population-based health management in the United States, clinicians and health system leaders need a deeper understanding of how to link patients in their healthcare systems with appropriate community programs. This review identifies key characteristics of successful fall prevention exercise programs that can be used to determine which local options conform to clinical evidence. In addition, we highlight tradeoffs between program options, such as home versus group exercise programs, to allow referrals to be tailored to local conditions and patient preferences. Finally, our work highlights the key role of the PCP in recruiting patients to participate in exercise programs, and identifies options, such as registries, to support referrals to the community."
Improving Adherence to Web-Based and Mobile Technologies for People With Psychosis: Systematic Review of New Potential Predictors of Adherence.	"BACKGROUND: Despite the boom in new technologically based interventions for people with psychosis, recent studies suggest medium to low rates of adherence to these types of interventions. The benefits will be limited if only a minority of service users adhere and engage; if specific predictors of adherence can be identified then technologies can be adapted to increase the service user benefits. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to present a systematic review of rates of adherence, dropout, and approaches to analyzing adherence to newly developed mobile and Web-based interventions for people with psychosis. Specific predictors of adherence were also explored. METHODS: Using keywords (Internet or online or Web-based or website or mobile) AND (bipolar disorder or manic depression or manic depressive illness or manic-depressive psychosis or psychosis or schizophr* or psychotic), the following databases were searched: OVID including MedLine, EMBASE and PsychInfo, Pubmed and Web of Science. The objectives and inclusion criteria for suitable studies were defined following PICOS (population: people with psychosis; intervention: mobile or Internet-based technology; comparison group: no comparison group specified; outcomes: measures of adherence; study design: randomized controlled trials (RCT), feasibility studies, and observational studies) criteria. In addition to measurement and analysis of adherence, two theoretically proposed predictors of adherence were examined: (1) level of support from a clinician or researcher throughout the study, and (2) level of service user involvement in the app or intervention development. We provide a narrative synthesis of the findings and followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting systematic reviews. RESULTS: Of the 20 studies that reported a measure of adherence and a rate of dropout, 5 of these conducted statistical analyses to determine predictors of dropout, 6 analyzed the effects of specific adherence predictors (eg, symptom severity or type of technological interface) on the effects of the intervention, 4 administered poststudy feedback questionnaires to assess continued use of the intervention, and 2 studies evaluated the effects of different types of interventions on adherence. Overall, the percentage of participants adhering to interventions ranged from 28-100% with a mean of 83%. Adherence was greater in studies with higher levels of social support and service user involvement in the development of the intervention. Studies of shorter duration also had higher rates of adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to mobile and Web-based interventions was robust across most studies. Although 2 studies found specific predictors of nonadherence (male gender and younger age), most did not specifically analyze predictors. The duration of the study may be an important predictor of adherence. Future studies should consider reporting a universal measure of adherence and aim to conduct complex analyses on predictors of adherence such as level of social presence and service user involvement.

IMPROVING CARE & HEALTH. Social Networking Strategies That Aim To Reduce Obesity Have Achieved Significant Although Modest Results	"The global epidemic of obesity continues to escalate. Obesity accounts for an increasing proportion of the international socioeconomic burden of noncommunicable disease. Online social networking services provide an effective medium through which information may be exchanged between obese and overweight patients and their health care providers, potentially contributing to superior weight-loss outcomes. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the role of these services in modifying body mass index (BMI). Our analysis of twelve studies found that interventions using social networking services produced a modest but significant 0.64 percent reduction in BMI from baseline for the 941 people who participated in the studies' interventions. We recommend that social networking services that target obesity should be the subject of further clinical trials. Additionally, we recommend that policy makers adopt reforms that promote the use of anti-obesity social networking services, facilitate multistakeholder partnerships in such services, and create a supportive environment to confront obesity and its associated noncommunicable diseases."
Improving Engagement in the HIV Care Cascade: A Systematic Review of Interventions Involving People Living with HIV/AIDS as Peers	"Improving patient engagement in HIV care is critical for maximizing the impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We conducted a systematic review of studies that used HIV-positive peers to bolster linkage, retention, and/or adherence to ART. We searched articles published and indexed in Pubmed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL between 1996 and 2014. Peers were required to be HIV-positive. Studies were restricted to those published in English. Nine studies with n = 4658 participants met the inclusion criteria. Peer-based interventions were predominantly focused on improving adherence to ART, or evaluations of retention and adherence via viral suppression. Five (56 %) were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Overall findings were mixed on the impact of peers on ART adherence, viral suppression, and mortality. While positive effects of peer interventions on improving linkage and retention were found, there were limited studies assessing these outcomes. Additional research is warranted to demonstrate the impact of peers on linkage and retention in diverse populations."
Improving health-promoting self-care in family carers of people with dementia: a review of interventions	"Background: Providing care for a family member with dementia can leave little time for carers to look after their own health needs, which makes them more susceptible to mental and physical health problems. This scoping review aimed to explore potential health benefits of interventions aimed at improving health-promoting self-care in family carers of people with dementia. Methods: A scoping review was carried out using Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework. EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were consulted. Original and peer-reviewed research published in English up to April 2017 were included. Publications were selected by two reviewers independently. Eight experts from several countries provided extra relevant information, which was triangulated with the review results. A narrative approach was used to describe and discuss the review findings. Results: Seven interventions were identified. These were highly heterogeneous in content, method of delivery, and outcome measures. None was specifically focused on improving and evaluating health-promoting self-care, instead they often focused on health promotion and healthy lifestyle (eg, physical activity). Some of the multi-component interventions included ""self-care"" as a domain, but none used a specific measure of health-promoting self-care, so we were unable to affirm that the improvements found in the interventions were due to an improvement in this area. Interventions helped reduce carer depression and burden and increased quality of life, positive affect, and physical activity. The expert panel recommended to consider carers' preparedness and capacity to adhere to self-care practices, as well as carers' age and culture. Future interventions should be context specific, flexible, and person-centered. Conclusion: Psychosocial interventions may improve health-promoting self-care behavior, but more research is needed to establish efficacy. Interventions should be flexible, use a person-centered approach, be implemented with fidelity and use the right dosage."
Incorporating mental health into health impact assessment in the United States: A systematic review	"Purpose: Health impact assessment (HIA) is a systematic research and public engagement tool used to elevate health and equity in public policies. However, HIA practitioners often overlook potential mental health impacts. The purpose of this paper is to review the degree to which mental health is included in HIAs in the USA. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a systematic review of 156 HIAs that were completed between 1993 and 2013 for their inclusion of mental health. HIAs were subdivided to assess if mental health conditions or their determinants were measured, and if predictions or mitigation strategies were made in the scoping, assessment, or recommendations phases. Findings: Overall, 73.1 percent of HIAs included mental health. Of the HIAs that included mental health (n = 114), 85.1 percent also included the determinants of mental health and 67.6 percent included mental health outcomes. 37.7 percent of HIAs measured baseline mental health conditions and 64.0 percent predicted changes in mental health as the result of implementing the proposed policy, plan, or program. Among the HIAs that made predictions about mental health, 79.5 percent included recommendations for potential changes in mental health, while only 46.6 percent had measured mental health at baseline. Research limitations/implications: Although many HIAs included mental health in some capacity, this paper quantifies that mental health is not included in a robust way in HIAs in the USA. This presents a difficulty for efforts to address the growing issues of mental health and mental health inequities in the populations. Originality/value: This paper represents the first academic endeavor to systematically assess the state of the field of HIA for its inclusion of mental health.

Incorporating Participatory Action Research in Attention Bias Modification Interventions for Addictive Disorders: Perspectives.	"Participatory action research was introduced in the 1960s and early 1970s, but it has only been more widely adopted in the recent years. Such methodologies have since been applied to several web & mobile-based interventions in psychiatry. To date no prior review has scoped the extent of the application of such methodologies for web & mobile-based interventions in psychiatry. In this article, a scoping literature review was performed, and seven articles have been identified. The most common methodologies are that of co-design workshops; and increasingly service users and participants are included in these workshops. There remains a lack of application of such methodologies for addiction research. Increasingly, attention and cognitive bias modification interventions are more commonplace, given that they have been found to be effective in modifying underlying biases amongst individuals with addictive disorders. Unfortunately, there remains to be inherent limitations with web and mobile versions of attention and cognitive bias modification interventions. Participatory design research methods could help address these limitations and future research involving the conceptualization of new attention or cognitive bias modification applications ought to consider the incorporation of these research methods."
Indigenous Australians Perceptions' of Physical Activity: A Qualitative Systematic Review.	"Given poorer health and higher rates of chronic disease seen in Indigenous populations around the world and the evidence linking exercise with health and wellbeing, recommendations for encouraging and increasing Indigenous people's participation in physical activity are needed. This paper systematically reviews published qualitative research papers exploring issues related to the perspectives of Indigenous Australians around physical activity. Key terms relevant to attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions of Indigenous Australians on physical activity and sport were explored in 11 electronic bibliographic databases including EMBASE, Medline and Web of Science. Of the 783 studies screened, eight qualitative studies met the selection criteria; only one was exclusively undertaken in a rural setting. Four major themes emerged: family and community, culture and environment, sport, and gender differences. Men highlighted sport and going on walkabout as preferred types of physical activity while women preferred family-focused activities and activities and support for women's sport. Several studies found exercise was supported when in the context of family and community but was considered shameful when done only for oneself. Sport was regarded as playing an influential role in bringing communities together. Group, community, or family activities were desired forms of physical activity with the environment they are conducted in of high importance. These findings should inform future research and intervention programs aimed at addressing the physical activity levels of Indigenous Australians and may be relevant to other Indigenous populations."
Indigenous healthcare worker involvement for Indigenous adults and children with asthma.	"Background Asthma education is regarded as an important step in the management of asthma in national guidelines. Racial, ethnicity and socio-economic factors are associated with markers of asthma severity, including recurrent acute presentations to emergency health facilities. Worldwide, indigenous groups are disproportionately represented in the severe end of the asthma spectrum. Appropriate models of care are important in the successful delivery of services, and are likely contributors to improved outcomes for people with asthma. Objectives To determine whether involvement of an Indigenous healthcare worker (IHW) in comparison to absence of an IHW in asthma education programs, improves asthma related outcomes in indigenous children and adults with asthma. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles. The latest search was in January 2011. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials comparing involvement of an Indigenous healthcare worker (IHW) in comparison to absence of an IHW in asthma education programs for indigenous people with asthma. Data collection and analysis Two independent review authors selected data for inclusion, a single author extracted the data. Both review authors independently assessed study quality. We contacted authors for further information. As it was not possible to analyse data as 'intention-to-treat', we analysed data as 'treatment received'. Main results One study fulfilled inclusion criteria involving 113 children randomised to an asthma education programme involving an IHW, compared to a similar education programme without an IHW. Eighty eight of these children completed the trial. Parents' asthma knowledge score (mean difference (MD) (7.49; 95% CI 5.52 to 9.46), parents' asthma skill score (MD 0.98; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.44) and days absent from school (100% school-aged children in the intervention group missed <7 days, 21% of controls missed 7-14 days, difference = 21%, 95% CI 5-36%) were significantly better in the intervention group compared to controls. There was no significant difference in mean number of exacerbations (per year) between groups. There was no difference in quality of life or children's asthma skill score; both were limited to one study only and the direction favoured IHW group. There were no studies in adults. Authors' conclusions The involvement of IHW in asthma programs targeted for their own ethnic group in one small trial was beneficial in improving most, but not all asthma outcomes in children with asthma. It is very likely that involvement of an IHW is beneficial. However as exacerbation frequency was not significantly different between groups, we cannot be confident of the results in all settings. Nevertheless, given the complexity of health outcomes and culture as well as the importance of self-determination for indigenous peoples, the practice of including IHW in asthma education programs for indigenous children and adults with asthma is justified, but should be subject to further randomised controlled trials."
"Indigenous Youth Peer-Led Health Promotion in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and the United States: A Systematic Review of the Approaches, Study Designs, and Effectiveness."	"Background: Youth peer-led interventions have become a popular way of sharing health information with young people and appear well suited to Indigenous community contexts. However, no systematic reviews focusing on Indigenous youth have been published. We conducted a systematic review to understand the range and characteristics of Indigenous youth-led health promotion projects implemented and their effectiveness. Methods: A systematic search of Medline, Embase, and ProQuest Social Sciences databases was conducted, supplemented by gray literature searches. Included studies focused on interventions where young Indigenous people delivered health information to age-matched peers. Results: Twenty-four studies were identified for inclusion, based on 20 interventions (9 Australian, 4 Canadian, and 7 from the United States of America). Only one intervention was evaluated using a randomized controlled study design. The majority of evaluations took the form of pre-post studies. Methodological limitations were identified in a majority of studies. Study outcomes included improved knowledge, attitude, and behaviors. Conclusion: Currently, there is limited high quality evidence for the effectiveness of peer-led health interventions with Indigenous young people, and the literature is dominated by Australian-based sexual health interventions. More systematic research investigating the effectiveness of peer-led inventions is required, specifically with Indigenous populations. To improve health outcomes for Indigenous youth, greater knowledge of the mechanisms and context under which peer-delivered health promotion is effective in comparison to other methods of health promotion is needed."
Individual and group based parenting programmes for improving psychosocial outcomes for teenage parents and their children.	"Background Parenting programmes are a potentially important means of supporting teenage parents and improving outcomes for their children, and parenting support is a priority across most Western countries. This review updates the previous version published in 2001. Objectives To examine the effectiveness of parenting programmes in improving psychosocial outcomes for teenage parents and developmental outcomes in their children. Search methods We searched to find new studies for this updated review in January 2008 and May 2010 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ASSIA, CINAHL, DARE, ERIC, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts and Social Science Citation Index. The National Research Register (NRR) was last searched in May 2005 and UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database in May 2010. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials assessing short-term parenting interventions aimed specifically at teenage parents and a control group (no-treatment, waiting list or treatment-as-usual). Data collection and analysis We assessed the risk of bias in each study. We standardised the treatment effect for each outcome in each study by dividing the mean difference in post-intervention scores between the intervention and control groups by the pooled standard deviation. Main results We included eight studies with 513 participants, providing a total of 47 comparisons of outcome between intervention and control conditions. Nineteen comparisons were statistically significant, all favouring the intervention group. We conducted nine meta-analyses using data from four studies in total (each meta-analysis included data from two studies). Four meta-analyses showed statistically significant findings favouring the intervention group for the following outcomes: parent responsiveness to the child post-intervention (SMD -0.91, 95% CI -1.52 to -0.30, P = 0.04); infant responsiveness to mother at follow-up (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -1.25 to -0.06, P = 0.03); and an overall measure of parent-child interactions post-intervention (SMD -0.71, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.11, P = 0.02), and at follow-up (SMD -0.90, 95% CI -1.51 to -0.30, P = 0.004). The results of the remaining five meta-analyses were inconclusive. Authors' conclusions Variation in the measures used, the included populations and interventions, and the risk of bias within the included studies limit the conclusions that can be reached. The findings provide some evidence to suggest that parenting programmes may be effective in improving a number of aspects of parent-child interaction both in the short- and long-term, but further research is now needed."
"Individual-, family-, and school-level interventions targeting multiple risk behaviours in young people."	"Background Engagement in multiple risk behaviours can have adverse consequences for health during childhood, during adolescence, and later in life, yet little is known about the impact of different types of interventions that target multiple risk behaviours in children and young people, or the differential impact of universal versus targeted approaches. Findings from systematic reviews have been mixed, and effects of these interventions have not been quantitatively estimated. Objectives To examine the effects of interventions implemented up to 18 years of age for the primary or secondary prevention of multiple risk behaviours among young people. Search methods We searched 11 databases (Australian Education Index; British Education Index; Campbell Library; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; Embase; Education Resource Information Center (ERIC); International Bibliography of the Social Sciences; MEDLINE; PsycINFO; and Sociological Abstracts) on three occasions (2012, 2015, and 14 November 2016)). We conducted handsearches of reference lists, contacted experts in the field, conducted citation searches, and searched websites of relevant organisations. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster RCTs, which aimed to address at least two risk behaviours. Participants were children and young people up to 18 years of age and/or parents, guardians, or carers, as long as the intervention aimed to address involvement in multiple risk behaviours among children and young people up to 18 years of age. However, studies could include outcome data on children > 18 years of age at the time of follow-up. Specifically,we included studies with outcomes collected from those eight to 25 years of age. Further, we included only studies with a combined intervention and follow-up period of six months or longer. We excluded interventions aimed at individuals with clinically diagnosed disorders along with clinical interventions. We categorised interventions according to whether they were conducted at the individual level; the family level; or the school level. Data collection and analysis We identified a total of 34,680 titles, screened 27,691 articles and assessed 424 full-text articles for eligibility. Two or more review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion in the review, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Main results We included in the review a total of 70 eligible studies, of which a substantial proportion were universal school-based studies (n = 28; 40%). Most studies were conducted in the USA (n = 55; 79%). On average, studies aimed to prevent four of the primary behaviours. Behaviours that were most frequently addressed included alcohol use (n = 55), drug use (n = 53), and/or antisocial behaviour (n = 53), followed by tobacco use (n = 42). No studies aimed to prevent self-harm or gambling alongside other behaviours. Authors' conclusions Available evidence is strongest for universal school-based interventions that target multiple- risk behaviours, demonstrating that they may be effective in preventing engagement in tobacco use, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and antisocial behaviour, and in improving physical activity among young people, but not in preventing other risk behaviours. Results of this review do not provide strong evidence of benefit for family- or individual-level interventions across the risk behaviours studied. However, poor reporting and concerns around the quality of evidence highlight the need for high-quality multiple- risk behaviour intervention studies to further strengthen the evidence base in this field."
Individual-level protective factors for sexual health outcomes among sexual minority youth: a systematic review of the literature.	"Although factors associated with negative sexual health outcomes among sexual minority youth (SMY) have been well documented, protective factors have been less studied. This review summarises the current state of science on individual-level protective factors for SMY and identifies gaps to inform future research. A systematic search of non-intervention, empirical peer-reviewed research was conducted. Articles that examined an a priori-identified individual-level protective factor and at least one sexual health outcome in a sample or subsample of SMY aged 10-24 years in Western, industrialised countries were eligible for inclusion. A total of 21 articles that reported data from 13 unique studies met inclusion criteria. Only two studies described findings for young sexual minority women and thus the literature synthesis was limited to studies reporting on young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in the USA. A total of 11 individual-level protective factors were examined. Subjective peer norms and attitudes about condom use were repeatedly protective in cross-sectional analyses. Findings related to self-efficacy, self-esteem and clear and positive identity were more mixed. The findings of this review suggest that attitudes and subjective peer norms related to condom use are promising intervention targets for YMSM. There is a need, however, for longitudinal research to confirm these protective effects and to consider them among other SMY. Moreover, protective factors related to skills and competencies have been insufficiently studied among SMY. Addressing these gaps will help develop a robust body of evidence to inform interventions."
Individualized plans of care to improve outcomes among children and adults with chronic illness: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Adults and children with chronic illness often require services from multiple providers. Individualized plans of care (IPCs) are sometimes developed to improve care coordination. However, their association with improved outcomes is unknown. METHODS: We searched literature published between January 2001 and October 2011, using Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychINFO, and bibliographic review. Eligible studies involved an IPC with input from the patient and/or family of individuals with chronic illness, evaluated outcomes, and were conducted in the United States. We assessed evidence quality using Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine criteria. RESULTS: 15 studies met inclusion criteria. Studies were heterogeneous regarding populations and outcomes examined and were generally low quality. Most described IPC use within a multifaceted care coordination intervention. The strongest evidence links IPC use and symptom improvement in depressed adults; the weakest evidence exists for outcomes in children. Vague descriptions of the IPCs' limited analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence supporting an association between IPC use and improved outcomes, particularly among children, is sparse. Well-designed evaluations of clearly described IPCs are needed to examine who should be involved in their development, what they should include, and how often they should be updated to improve outcomes of care for this vulnerable population."
Influence of Diet in Multiple Sclerosis: A Systematic Review	"Nutrition is considered to be a possible factor in the pathogenesis of the neurological disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Nutrition intervention studies suggest that diet may be considered as a complementary treatment to control the progression of the disease; a systematic review of the literature on the influence of diet on MS was therefore conducted. The literature search was conducted by using Medlars Online International Literature (MEDLINE) via PubMed and Scopus. Forty-seven articles met the inclusion criteria. The reviewed articles assessed the relations between macro- and micronutrient intakes and MS incidence. The patients involved used alternative therapies (homeopathy), protocolized diets that included particular foods (herbal products such as grape seed extract, ginseng, blueberries, green tea, etc.), or dietary supplements such as vitamin D, carnitine, melatonin, or coenzyme Q10. Current studies suggest that high serum concentrations of vitamin D, a potent immunomodulator, may decrease the risk of MS and the risk of relapse and new lesions, while improving brain lesions and timed tandem walking. Experimental evidence suggests that serum vitamin D concentration is lower during MS relapses than in remission and is associated with a greater degree of disability Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score >3]. The findings suggest that circulating vitamin D concentrations can be considered a biomarker of MS and supplemental vitamin D can be used therapeutically. Other studies point to a negative correlation between serum vitamin B-12 concentrations and EDSS score. Vitamin B-12 has fundamental roles in central nervous system function, especially in the methionine synthase-mediated conversion of homocysteine to methionine, which is essential for DNA and RNA synthesis. Therefore, vitamin B-12 deficiency may lead to an increase in the concentration of homocysteine. Further research is clearly necessary to determine whether treatment with vitamin B-12 supplements delays MS progression. Copyright ¬© 2017 American Society for Nutrition."
Information and participation preferences and needs of non-Western ethnic minority cancer patients and survivors: A systematic review of the literature	"OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of information and participation preferences and needs of non-Western ethnic minority cancer patients living in Western countries. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using the databases PsycINFO, PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE. Thematic analysis was carried out to synthesize data, allowing for identification of important themes and synthesis of both qualitative and quantitative studies. RESULTS: Forty-four papers were included. Non- Western ethnic minority cancer patients/survivors have high information preferences and needs regarding topics ranging from diagnosis to treatment and from prevention to the healthcare system. Younger, female, and unmarried patients/survivors, and patients with better language proficiency reported higher information preferences. Latin-American and African-American patients/survivors primarily prefer shared or active participation. Asian and Middle-Eastern patients/survivors prefer primarily passive participation. Younger patients, and those with a higher level of education and acculturation were more likely to prefer active or shared participation. CONCLUSION: Further (quantitative) research on factors associated with patients' preferences is needed in order to better understand the underlying reasons of information and participation preferences and needs of diverse non-Western ethnic minority cancer patients. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: To better fulfil ethnic minority patients'/survivors' preferences and needs healthcare providers should elaborate upon these and tailor their information- provision accordingly.

Information visualizations of symptom information for patients and providers: a systematic review.	"Objective: To systematically synthesize the literature on information visualizations of symptoms included as National Institute of Nursing Research common data elements and designed for use by patients and/or healthcare providers. Methods: We searched CINAHL, Engineering Village, PsycINFO, PubMed, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Explore Digital Library to identify peer-reviewed studies published between 2007 and 2017. We evaluated the studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) and a visualization quality score, and organized evaluation findings according to the Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Model. Results: Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria. Ten of these addressed all MMAT items; 13 addressed all visualization quality items. Symptom visualizations focused on pain, fatigue, and sleep and were represented as graphs (n = 14), icons (n = 4), and virtual body maps (n = 2). Studies evaluated perceived ease of use (n = 13), perceived usefulness (n = 12), efficiency (n = 9), effectiveness (n = 5), preference (n = 6), and intent to use (n = 3). Few studies reported race/ethnicity or education level. Conclusion: The small number of studies for each type of information visualization limit generalizable conclusions about optimal visualization approaches. User-centered participatory approaches for information visualization design and more sophisticated evaluation designs are needed to assess which visualization elements work best for which populations in which contexts."
Inpatient Portals for Hospitalized Patients and Caregivers: A Systematic Review.	"Patient portals, web-based personal health records linked to electronic health records (EHRs), provide patients access to their healthcare information and facilitate communication with providers. Growing evidence supports portal use in ambulatory settings; however, only recently have portals been used with hospitalized patients. Our objective was to review the literature evaluating the design, use, and impact of inpatient portals, which are patient portals designed to give hospitalized patients and caregivers inpatient EHR clinical information for the purpose of engaging them in hospital care. Literature was reviewed from 2006 to 2017 in PubMed, Web of Science, CINALPlus, Cochrane, and Scopus to identify English language studies evaluating patient portals, engagement, and inpatient care. Data were analyzed considering the following 3 themes: inpatient portal design, use and usability, and impact. Of 731 studies, 17 were included, 9 of which were published after 2015. Most studies were qualitative with small samples focusing on inpatient portal design; 1 nonrandomized trial was identified. Studies described hospitalized patients' and caregivers' information needs and design recommendations. Most patient and caregiver participants in included studies were interested in using an inpatient portal, used it when offered, and found it easy to use and/or useful. Evidence supporting the role of inpatient portals in improving patient and caregiver engagement, knowledge, communication, and care quality and safety is limited. Included studies indicated providers had concerns about using inpatient portals; however, the extent to which these concerns have been realized remains unclear. Inpatient portal research is emerging. Further investigation is needed to optimally design inpatient portals to maximize potential benefits for hospitalized patients and caregivers while minimizing unintended consequences for healthcare teams.

Integrated Knowledge Translation with Public Health Policy Makers: A Scoping Review.	"Integrated knowledge translation (iKT) refers to the engagement of knowledge users (e.g., policy makers, clinicians, patients) as active participants in the research process. Theoretically, this involvement enhances research relevancy and usefulness, thereby supporting health system change. However, evidence to support best practices for iKT is lacking, particularly in a public health context and with non-clinical decision-makers. The objectives of this research were to report how decision-maker involvement in public health iKT research has been described and operationalized and whether the process was evaluated. We conducted a scoping review of published literature from January 2005 to December 2017 and extracted information related to iKT involvement, barriers and facilitators and outcomes. Studies typically did not distinguish between different kinds of knowledge users, making it impossible to comment specifically on decision-makers' involvement. Authors believed knowledge user involvement was beneficial to the quality and potential impact of research activities, although corroborating evaluation data were unavailable. Broad research-knowledge user partnerships spanning multiple projects, as well as flexible involvement of knowledge users, enhanced engagement and supported the iKT process.

Integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) strategy for children under five.	"Background: More than 7.5 million children younger than age five living in low- and middle-income countries die every year. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) strategy to reduce mortality and morbidity and to improve quality of care by improving the delivery of a variety of curative and preventive medical and behavioral interventions at health facilities, at home, and in the community. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of programs that implement the IMCI strategy in terms of death, nutritional status, quality of care, coverage with IMCI deliverables, and satisfaction of beneficiaries. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 3), including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register; MEDLINE; EMBASE, Ovid; the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EbscoHost; the Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Virtual Health Library (VHL); the WHO Library & Information Networks for Knowledge Database (WHOLIS); the Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index, Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science; Population Information Online (POPLINE); the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP); and the Global Health, Ovid and Health Management, ProQuest database. We performed searches until 30 June 2015 and supplemented these by searching revised bibliographies and by contacting experts to identify ongoing and unpublished studies. Selection criteria: We sought to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled before-after (CBA) studies with at least two intervention and two control sites evaluating the generic IMCI strategy or its adaptation in children younger than age five, and including at minimum efforts to improve health care worker skills for case management. We excluded studies in which IMCI was accompanied by other interventions including conditional cash transfers, food supplementation, and employment. The comparison group received usual health services without provision of IMCI. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened searches, selected trials, and extracted, analysed and tabulated data. We used inverse variance for cluster trials and an intracluster co-efficient of 0.01 when adjustment had not been made in the primary study. We used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Main results: Two cluster-randomised trials (India and Bangladesh) and two controlled before-after studies (Tanzania and India) met our inclusion criteria. Strategies included training of health care staff, management strengthening of health care systems (all four studies), and home visiting (two studies). The two studies from India included care packages targeting the neonatal period. One trial in Bangladesh estimated that child mortality may be 13% lower with IMCI, but the confidence interval (CI) included no effect (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.10; 5090 participants; low-certainty evidence). One CBA study in Tanzania gave almost identical estimates (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.05; 1932 participants). One trial in India examined infant and neonatal mortality by implementing the integrated management of neonatal and childhood illness (IMNCI) strategy including post-natal home visits. Neonatal and infant mortality may be lower in the IMNCI group compared with the control group (infant mortality hazard ratio (HR) 0.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.94; neonatal mortality HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.03; one trial, 60,480 participants; low-certainty evidence). We estimated the effect of IMCI on any mortality measured by combining infant and child mortality in the one IMCI and the one IMNCI trial. Mortality may be reduced by IMCI (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93; two trials, 65,570 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two trials (India, Bangladesh) evaluated nutritional status and noted that there may be little or no effect on stunting (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.06; 5242 participants, two trials; low-certainty evidence) and there is probably little or no effect on wasting (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25; two trials, 4288 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).The Tanzania CBA study showed similar results. Investigators measured quality of care by observing prescribing for common illnesses at health facilities (727 observations, two studies; very low-certainty evidence) and by observing prescribing by lay health care workers (1051 observations, three studies; very low-certainty evidence). We could not confirm a consistent effect on prescribing at health facilities or by lay health care workers, as certainty of the evidence was very low. For coverage of IMCI deliverables, we examined vaccine and vitamin A coverage, appropriate care seeking, and exclusive breast feeding. Two trials (India, Bangladesh) estimated vaccine coverage for measles and reported that there is probably little or no effect on measles vaccine coverage (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.05; two trials, 4895 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with similar effects seen in the Tanzania CBA study. Two studies measured the third dose of diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus vaccine; and two measured vitamin A coverage, all providing little or no evidence of increased coverage with IMCI. Four studies (2 from India, and 1 each from Tanzania and Bangladesh) reported appropriate care seeking and derived information from careful questioning of mothers about recent illness. Some studies on effects of IMCI may report better care seeking behavior, but others do not report this. All four studies recorded maternal responses on exclusive breast feeding. They provided mixed results and very low-certainty evidence. Therefore, we do not know whether IMCI impacts exclusive breast feeding. No studies reported on the satisfaction of mothers and service users. Authors' conclusions: The mix of interventions examined in research studies evaluating the IMCI strategy varies, and some studies include specific inputs to improve neonatal health. Most studies were conducted in South Asia. Implementing the integrated management of childhood illness strategy may reduce child mortality, and packages that include interventions for the neonatal period may reduce infant mortality. IMCI may have little or no effect on nutritional status and probably has little or no effect on vaccine coverage. Maternal care seeking behavior may be more appropriate with IMCI, but study results have been mixed, providing evidence of very low certainty about whether IMCI has effects on adherence to exclusive breast feeding."
Integrated services for women through a One Stop Shop: a realist review	"Purpose Äì One Stop Shops (OSSs) are a model of integrated delivery, where a range of needs are met in one place through a bespoke, person-centred service that works across organisational and sectoral boundaries. Third Sector Organisations provide OSSs for women in the criminal justice system and whilst they are shown to be effective in meeting complex needs, how this effectiveness is generated needs explaining. The purpose of this paper is to set out a preliminary framework for explaining their effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach Äì A realist review was conducted to research the way in which context influences how OSSs work. This approach was chosen because it is designed to synthesise evidence on social programmes and policies which are complex. The review was conducted in two phases: theory building and theory refinement. Findings Äì The review explains how individual, interpersonal, institutional and infrastructural contexts influence the effectiveness of OSSs. The evidence suggested that the organisational or legal form of the provider is not as important as the values and attitudes of their staff. Originality/value Äì The paper adds to our understanding of how OSS services work, and gives insight for commissioners and Third Sector providers of services by beginning to explain how this effectiveness is generated."
"Integrating Evidence From Systematic Reviews, Qualitative Research, and Expert Knowledge Using Co-Design Techniques to Develop a Web-Based Intervention for People in the Retirement Transition"	"BACKGROUND: Integrating stakeholder involvement in complex health intervention design maximizes acceptability and potential effectiveness. However, there is little methodological guidance about how to integrate evidence systematically from various sources in this process. Scientific evidence derived from different approaches can be difficult to integrate and the problem is compounded when attempting to include diverse, subjective input from stakeholders. OBJECTIVE: The intent of the study was to describe and appraise a systematic, sequential approach to integrate scientific evidence, expert knowledge and experience, and stakeholder involvement in the co-design and development of a complex health intervention. The development of a Web-based lifestyle intervention for people in retirement is used as an example. METHODS: Evidence from three systematic reviews, qualitative research findings, and expert knowledge was compiled to produce evidence statements (stage 1). Face validity of these statements was assessed by key stakeholders in a co-design workshop resulting in a set of intervention principles (stage 2). These principles were assessed for face validity in a second workshop, resulting in core intervention concepts and hand-drawn prototypes (stage 3). The outputs from stages 1-3 were translated into a design brief and specification (stage 4), which guided the building of a functioning prototype, Web-based intervention (stage 5). This prototype was de-risked resulting in an optimized functioning prototype (stage 6), which was subject to iterative testing and optimization (stage 7), prior to formal pilot evaluation. RESULTS: The evidence statements (stage 1) highlighted the effectiveness of physical activity, dietary and social role interventions in retirement; the idiosyncratic nature of retirement and well-being; the value of using specific behavior change techniques including those derived from the Health Action Process Approach; and the need for signposting to local resources. The intervention principles (stage 2) included the need to facilitate self-reflection on available resources, personalization, and promotion of links between key lifestyle behaviors. The core concepts and hand-drawn prototypes (stage 3) had embedded in them the importance of time use and work exit planning, personalized goal setting, and acceptance of a Web-based intervention. The design brief detailed the features and modules required (stage 4), guiding the development of wireframes, module content and functionality, virtual mentors, and intervention branding (stage 5). Following an iterative process of intervention testing and optimization (stage 6), the final Web-based intervention prototype of LEAP (Living, Eating, Activity, and Planning in retirement) was produced (stage 7). The approach was resource intensive and required a multidisciplinary team. The design expert made an invaluable contribution throughout the process. CONCLUSIONS: Our sequential approach fills an important methodological gap in the literature, describing the stages and techniques useful in developing an evidence-based complex health intervention. The systematic and rigorous integration of scientific evidence, expert knowledge and experience, and stakeholder input has resulted in an intervention likely to be acceptable and feasible."
Integrative effect of yoga practice in patients with knee arthritis: A PRISMA-compliant meta-analysis.	"BACKGROUND: Benefits of yoga practice in patients with knee osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis remains controversial. This study performs a meta-analysis to quantify the efficiency of yoga exercise for patients pain reduction, functional recovery, and general wellbeing. METHODS: A computerized search of PubMed and Embase was performed to identify relevant studies. The outcome measures were pain, stiffness, and physical function. Two investigators identified eligible studies and extracted data independently. The quality of citations was measured using Jadad score. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for pain, musculoskeletal impairment, quality of life, general wellbeing, and mental wellbeing. RESULTS: A total of 13 clinical trials involving 1557 patients with knee osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis were included in final meta-analysis with the average Jadad score 2.8. The SMD was -0.98 (95% CI -1.18, -0.78, P < .05) for pain, -1.83 (95% CI -2.09, -1.57, P < .05) for functional disability, was 0.80 (95% CI 0.59, 1.01, P < .05) for Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) general health, 0.49 (95% CI 0.14, 0.82, P < .05) for SF-36 mental health, and HAQ was -0.55 (95% CI -0.83, -0.26, P < .05) for health associated questionnaire (HAQ). All the results favor yoga training group. CONCLUSIONS: Regular yoga training is helpful in reducing knee arthritic symptoms, promoting physical function, and general wellbeing in arthritic patients."
Integrative Review of Genetic Factors Influencing Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in Preterm Infants	"Preterm infants are at elevated risk for a host of neurodevelopmental problems, including disorders that appear later in life. Gene-environment interactions and prematurity may combine to increase the risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Increasing evidence supports a genetic link to risk for atypical development; however, no genomic risk profiles are currently used for infants without apparent genetic disorders. The purpose of this review was to synthesize recent evidence of genetic associations with atypical neurodevelopmental outcomes that may affect preterm infants who do not have a rare genetic disease. Electronic and hand-search strategies were used to find relevant articles that were English-language, peer-reviewed primary research or meta-analysis reports published between July 2009 and July 2014, involving human participants. Articles included in the analysis (N = 29) used a wide range of study designs and methodologies, complicating the analysis. An integrative-review design was used to synthesize the data. Numerous genes (n = 43) and additional large deletion copy number variants were associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes, including cognition, attention, perception, psychiatric disease, autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, infant behavior, and alterations in brain architecture. The creation of genetic risk profiles for complex disorders of neurodevelopment is presently hindered by inconsistent genetic-association evidence, methodological considerations, reporting problems, and lack of replication. However, several avenues of investigation offer promise, including large (> 100 kb) copy number variants and the candidate genes MET, NRG3, and SLC6A4, each of which were reported to have associations with neurodevelopmental outcomes in multiple, high-quality studies."
Integrative Review of the Factors That Influence Fathers' Involvement in the Breastfeeding of Their Infants.	"OBJECTIVE: To integrate research findings related to the factors that influence fathers' involvement in the breastfeeding of their infants. DATA SOURCES: Five electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) were searched with the keywords breastfeeding, factors, fathers, involvement, partner, and parent to identify studies that were published in English through July 2018. STUDY SELECTION: The initial search produced 11,927 articles. After the removal of non-English articles and duplicates, a total of 7,533 articles remained. Application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria to titles and abstracts resulted in the elimination of 7,061 articles. In-depth reviews of the remaining 472 full-text articles according to quality appraisal resulted in 39 articles for inclusion in this review. DATA EXTRACTION: We extracted specific information from each article's purpose, methods, setting, and key findings sections that explained factors that influenced fathers' involvement in the breastfeeding of their infants. DATA SYNTHESIS: Thematic analysis was used to synthesize the findings into seven themes: Fathers' Knowledge Regarding Breastfeeding, Fathers' Attitudes Toward Breastfeeding, Fathers' Perceptions of Subjective Norms Surrounding Their Involvement in Breastfeeding, Fathers' Perceived Behavioral Control of Their Involvement, Committed Relationship, Sociodemographic Characteristics, and Fathers' Attendance at Antenatal Classes."
Integrative Review: Delivery of Healthcare Services to Adolescents and Young Adults During and After Foster Care	"The purpose of this integrative review is to summarize evidence describing delivery of healthcare services to adolescents while in foster care and to young adults after they exit foster care. The long-term, deleterious effect of abuse and/or neglect by caregivers among youth who have been placed in foster care is grounded in empirical evidence demonstrating the relationship between long-term health needs and exposure to trauma in childhood. Evidence is needed to provide culturally-specific care and also to identify knowledge gaps in the care of adolescents and young adults who have been in the foster care system. Peer-reviewed research studies published between 2004 and 2014 that include samples of youth 12 to 30 years of age are included in the review. Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria for the review. Physical and behavioral healthcare needs among youth with foster care experience are significant. The ability to adequately meet health needs are inextricable from the ability to negotiate resources and to successfully interact with adults. Challenges that youth with foster care histories experience when transitioning into young adulthood are comparable to other populations of vulnerable youth not in foster care. Nurses must use each healthcare encounter to assess how the social determinants of health facilitate or impede optimal health among youth with foster care experience. The development of integrated intervention strategies to inform best practice models is a priority for current and former foster care youth as they transition into young adulthood."
Integrative therapies for low back pain that include complementary and alternative medicine care: A systematic review.	"Study Design: Systematic review of the literature. Objective: To evaluate whether an integrated approach that includes different Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) therapies combined or CAM therapies combined with conventional medical care is more effective for the management of low back pain (LBP) than single modalities alone. Summary of Background Data: LBP is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, yet its optimal management is still unresolved. Methods: The PRISMA Statement guidelines were followed. The Cochrane Back Review Group scale was used to rate the quality of the studies found. Results: Twenty-one studies were found that met the inclusion criteria. The CAM modalities used in the studies included spinal manipulative therapy, acupuncture, exercise therapy, physiotherapy, massage therapy, and a topical ointment. Twenty studies included acupuncture and/or spinal manipulative therapy. Nine high quality studies showed that integrative care was clinically effective for the management of LBP. Spinal manipulative therapy combined with exercise therapy and acupuncture combined with conventional medical care or with exercise therapy appears to be promising approaches to the management of chronic cases of LBP. Conclusions: There is support in the literature for integrated CAM and conventional medical therapy for the management of chronic LBP. Further research into the integrated management of LBP is clearly needed to provide better guidance for patients and clinicians."
Internet-Based Interventions for Problem Gambling: Scoping Review	"BACKGROUND: This study seeks to give an overview of academic research on internet-based interventions that are used to address problem gambling. The rate of treatment seeking has been demonstrated to be low across several research environments. This is in part because of the systemic barriers that treatment seekers face to accessing traditional face-to-face treatment. Making treatment resources for problem gambling available through the internet is one way to reduce the impact of those systemic barriers. The use of internet-based resources to address problem gambling has been growing, and a field of research evaluating it has developed as well. However, little has been done to summarize this collection of research. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide a scoping review of the use of internet-based interventions for problem gambling treatment and prevention to provide an understanding of the current state of the field. METHODS: A scoping review was performed for 6 peer-reviewed research databases (Web of Science, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, MEDLINE, Social Science Abstracts, and Scopus) and 3 gray literature databases (MedEdPortal, Proquest: Dissertations, and OpenGrey). Article inclusion criteria were as follows: published over the 10-year period of 2007 to 2017, including an intervention for problem gambling, and involving the use of internet to deliver that intervention. RESULTS: A total of 27 articles were found that met the review criteria. Studies were found from several different areas, with particularly strong representation for Australia, New Zealand, and Scandinavia. Cognitive behavioral therapy was the most common form of internet-based intervention. Internet-based interventions were generally shown to be effective in reducing problem gambling scores and gambling behaviors. A wide range of interventions that made use of internet resources included text-based interactions with counselors and peers, automated personalized and normative feedback on gambling behaviors, and interactive cognitive behavioral therapies. A lack of diversity in samples, little comparison with face-to-face interventions, and issues of changes in the treatment dynamic are identified as areas that require further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Internet-based interventions are a promising direction for treatment and prevention of problem gambling, particularly in reducing barriers to accessing professional help. The state of the current literature is sparse, and more research is needed for directly comparing internet-based interventions and their traditional counterparts.

Internet-based interventions for smoking cessation.	"Background Tobacco use is estimated to kill 7 million people a year. Nicotine is highly addictive, but surveys indicate that almost 70% of US and UK smokers would like to stop smoking. Although many smokers attempt to give up on their own, advice from a health professional increases the chances of quitting. As of 2016 there were 3.5 billion Internet users worldwide, making the Internet a potential platform to help people quit smoking. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of Internet-based interventions for smoking cessation, whether intervention effectiveness is altered by tailoring or interactive features, and if there is a difference in effectiveness between adolescents, young adults, and adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, which included searches of MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO (through OVID). There were no restrictions placed on language, publication status or publication date. The most recent search was conducted in August 2016. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Participants were people who smoked, with no exclusions based on age, gender, ethnicity, language or health status. Any type of Internet intervention was eligible. The comparison condition could be a no-intervention control, a different Internet intervention, or a non-Internet intervention. To be included, studies must have measured smoking cessation at four weeks or longer. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed and extracted data. We extracted and, where appropriate, pooled smoking cessation outcomes of six-month follow-up or more, reporting short-term outcomes narratively where longer-term outcomes were not available. We reported study effects as a risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Main results We identified 67 RCTs, including data from over 110,000 participants. We pooled data from 35,969 participants. Authors' conclusions The evidence from trials in adults suggests that interactive and tailored Internet-based interventions with or without additional behavioural support are moderately more effective than non-active controls at six months or longer, but there was no evidence that these interventions were better than other active smoking treatments. However some of the studies were at high risk of bias, and there was evidence of substantial statistical heterogeneity. Treatment effectiveness in younger people is unknown."
Internet-based interventions for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.	"Background The Internet could provide a means of delivering secondary prevention programmes to people with coronary heart disease (CHD). Objectives To determine the effectiveness of Internet-based interventions targeting lifestyle changes and medicines management for the secondary prevention of CHD. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, in December 2014. We also searched six other databases in October 2014, and three trials registers in January 2015 together with reference checking and handsearching to identify additional studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating Internet-delivered secondary prevention interventions aimed at people with CHD. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We assessed evidence quality using the GRADE approach and presented this in a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results Eighteen trials met our inclusion criteria. Eleven studies are complete (1392 participants), and seven are ongoing. Of the completed studies, seven interventions are broad, targeting the lifestyle management of CHD, and four focused on physical activity promotion. The comparison group in trials was usual care (n = 6), minimal intervention (n = 3), or traditional cardiac rehabilitation (n = 2). Authors' conclusions In general, evidence was of low quality due to lack of blinding, loss to follow-up, and uncertainty around the effect size. Few studies measured clinical events, and of those that did, a very small number of events were reported, and therefore no firm conclusions can be made. Similarly, there was no clear evidence of effect for cardiovascular risk factors, although again the number of studies reporting these was small. There was some evidence for beneficial effects on HRQOL, dietary outcomes, and physical activity, although firm conclusions cannot yet be made. The effects on healthcare utilisation and cost-effectiveness are also inconclusive, and trials are yet to measure the impact of Internet interventions on compliance with medication. The comparison groups differed across trials, and there were insufficient studies with usable data for subgroup analyses. We intend to study the intensity of comparison groups in future updates of this review when more evidence is available. The completion of the ongoing trials will add to the evidence base."
Internet-based self-monitoring interventions for overweight and obese adolescents: A systematic review and meta-analysis	"BACKGROUND: Internet-based self-monitoring intervention offers accessibleand convenient weight management. This review aimed to systematically review the evidence on the effectiveness of internet-based self-monitoring intervention for overweight and obese adolescents. METHOD: PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, ProQuest, PsycINFO and SCOPUS were systematically searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from inception until December 13, 2017. The risk of bias and strength of evidence was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations criteria. Meta-analysis was performed on the RevMan software using a random effects model. The overall effect was assessed using effect size (Cohen'sd)and heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochrane Q and I2 values. PROSPERO database #CRD42016050089. RESULTS: A total of 6841 records were identified. Six RCTs in 10 articles were selected amongst 505 adolescents across three countries who were overweight and obese. The meta-analysis revealed a small effect on the reduction of body mass index (BMI) and BMI z-scores (d = 0.30, 95% CI: -0.48 to -0.12). Subgroup analyses suggest the use of daily multicomponent self-monitoring, specified goal setting, face-to-face counselling and parental involvement. The overall quality of evidence was low due to the risk of bias and imprecision. CONCLUSION: Internet-based self-monitoring intervention is a possible approach for overweight and obese adolescents to reduce their BMI. Further well-designed RCTs with follow-up data and large sample sizes are needed to ensure the robustness of the evidence. Copyright ¬© 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Internet-Delivered Health Interventions That Work: Systematic Review of Meta-Analyses and Evaluation of Website Availability	"BACKGROUND: Due to easy access and low cost, Internet-delivered therapies offer an attractive alternative to improving health. Although numerous websites contain health-related information, finding evidence-based programs (as demonstrated through randomized controlled trials, RCTs) can be challenging. We sought to bridge the divide between the knowledge gained from RCTs and communication of the results by conducting a global systematic review and analyzing the availability of evidence-based Internet health programs. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to (1) discover the range of health-related topics that are addressed through Internet-delivered interventions, (2) generate a list of current websites used in the trials which demonstrate a health benefit, and (3) identify gaps in the research that may have hindered dissemination. Our focus was on Internet-delivered self-guided health interventions that did not require real-time clinical support. METHODS: A systematic review of meta-analyses was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (PROSPERO Registration Number CRD42016041258). MEDLINE via Ovid, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) were searched. Inclusion criteria included (1) meta-analyses of RCTs, (2) at least one Internet-delivered intervention that measured a health-related outcome, and (3) use of at least one self-guided intervention. We excluded group-based therapies. There were no language restrictions. RESULTS: Of the 363 records identified through the search, 71 meta-analyses met inclusion criteria. Within the 71 meta-analyses, there were 1733 studies that contained 268 unique RCTs which tested self-help interventions. On review of the 268 studies, 21.3% (57/268) had functional websites. These included evidence-based Web programs on substance abuse (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis), mental health (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD], phobias, panic disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder OCD]), and on diet and physical activity. There were also evidence-based programs on insomnia, chronic pain, cardiovascular risk, and childhood health problems. These programs tended to be intensive, requiring weeks to months of engagement by the user, often including interaction, personalized and normative feedback, and self-monitoring. English was the most common language, although some were available in Spanish, French, Portuguese, Dutch, German, Norwegian, Finnish, Swedish, and Mandarin. There were several interventions with numbers needed to treat of <5; these included painACTION, Mental Health Online for panic disorders, Deprexis, Triple P Online (TPOL), and U Can POOP Too. Hyperlinks of the sites have been listed. CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of evidence-based Internet programs are currently available for health-related behaviors, as well as disease prevention and treatment. However, the majority of Internet-delivered health interventions found to be efficacious in RCTs do not have websites for general use. Increased efforts to provide mechanisms to host ""interventions that work"" on the Web and to assist the public in locating these sites are necessary.

Internet-Delivered Self-management Support for Improving Coronary Heart Disease and Self-management-Related Outcomes: A Systematic Review	"INTRODUCTION: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, including mental health comorbidity, which is associated with poor outcomes. Self-management is key, but there is limited access to self-management support. Internet-delivered interventions may increase access. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to (1) determine the effectiveness of Internet-delivered CHD self-management support for improving CHD, mood, and self-management related outcomes and (2) identify and describe essential components for effectiveness. METHOD: Randomized controlled trials that met prespecified eligibility criteria were identified using a systematic search of 3 healthcare databases (Medline, PsychINFO, and Embase). RESULTS: Seven trials, which included 1321 CHD patients, were eligible for inclusion. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies in terms of the intervention content, outcomes measured, and study quality. All 7 of the studies reported significant positive between-group effects, in particular for lifestyle-related outcomes. Personalization of interventions and provision of support to promote engagement may be associated with improved outcomes, although more data are required to confirm this. The theoretical basis of interventions was poorly developed though evidence-based behavior change interventions were used. CONCLUSION: More well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed. These should also explore how interventions work and how to improve participant retention and satisfaction and examine the role of personalization and support within interventions."
Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) as a tool for participatory research within Critical Autism Studies: A systematic review.	"Purpose: Interpretative phenomenological analysis is distinctive in foregrounding participants' interpretations. As such, it is potentially useful for gaining an insight into the lived experience of autistic individuals and aligns well with participatory approaches. This paper provides the first systematic review of IPA studies that have employed a participatory approach and considers their contribution to Critical Autism Studies."
Interventions for female drug-using offenders.	"Background This is an updated version of a Cochrane review first published in Issue 3, 2006 (). The review represents one in a family of four reviews focusing on the effectiveness of interventions in reducing drug use and criminal activity for offenders. This specific review considers interventions for female drug-using offenders. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions for female drug-using offenders in reducing criminal activity, or drug use, or both. Search methods We searched 14 electronic bibliographic databases up to May 2014 and five additional Website resources (between 2004 and November 2011). We contacted experts in the field for further information. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) designed to reduce, eliminate or prevent relapse of drug use or criminal activity in female drug-using offenders. We also reported data on the cost and cost-effectiveness of interventions. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results Nine trials with 1792 participants met the inclusion criteria. Trial quality and risks of bias varied across each study. We rated the majority of studies as being at 'unclear' risk of bias due to a lack of descriptive information. We divided the studies into different categories for the purpose of meta-analyses: for any psychosocial treatments in comparison to treatment as usual we found low quality evidence that there were no significant differences in arrest rates, (two studies; 489 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.52) or drug use (one study; 77 participants; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.12), but we found moderate quality evidence that there was a significant reduction in reincarceration, (three studies; 630 participants; RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.64). Pharmacological intervention using buprenorphine in comparison to a placebo did not significantly reduce self reported drug use (one study; 36 participants; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.35). No cost or cost-effectiveness evidence was reported in the studies. Authors' conclusions Three of the nine trials show a positive trend towards the use of any psychosocial treatment in comparison to treatment as usual showing an overall significant reduction in subsequent reincarceration, but not arrest rates or drug use. Pharmacological interventions in comparison to a placebo did not significantly reduce drug use and did not measure criminal activity. Four different treatment comparisons showed varying results and were not combined due to differences in the intervention and comparison groups. The studies overall showed a high degree of heterogeneity for types of comparisons and outcome measures assessed, which limited the possibility to pool the data. Descriptions of treatment modalities are required to identify the important elements for treatment success in drug-using female offenders. More trials are required to increase the precision of confidence with which we can draw conclusions about the effectiveness of treatments for female drug-using offenders."
Interventions for increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in children aged five years and under.	"Background Insufficient consumption of fruits and vegetables in childhood increases the risk of future non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease. Interventions to increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, such as those focused on specific child-feeding strategies and parent nutrition education interventions in early childhood may therefore be an effective strategy in reducing this disease burden. Objectives To assess the effectiveness, cost effectiveness and associated adverse events of interventions designed to increase the consumption of fruit, vegetables or both amongst children aged five years and under. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and two clinical trials registries to identify eligible trials on 25 January 2018. We searched Proquest Dissertations and Theses in November 2017. We reviewed reference lists of included trials and handsearched three international nutrition journals. We contacted authors of included studies to identify further potentially relevant trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials, including cluster-randomised controlled trials and cross-over trials, of any intervention primarily targeting consumption of fruit, vegetables or both among children aged five years and under, and incorporating a dietary or biochemical assessment of fruit or vegetable consumption. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts of identified papers; a third review author resolved disagreements. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risks of bias of included studies; a third review author resolved disagreements. Due to unexplained heterogeneity, we used random-effects models in meta-analyses for the primary review outcomes where we identified sufficient trials. We calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) to account for the heterogeneity of fruit and vegetable consumption measures. We conducted assessments of risks of bias and evaluated the quality of evidence (GRADE approach) using Cochrane procedures. Main results We included 63 trials with 178 trial arms and 11,698 participants. Thirty-nine trials examined the impact of child-feeding practices (e.g. repeated food exposure) in increasing child vegetable intake. Fourteen trials examined the impact of parent nutrition education in increasing child fruit and vegetable intake. Nine studies examined the impact of multicomponent interventions (e.g. parent nutrition education and preschool policy changes) in increasing child fruit and vegetable intake. One study examined the effect of a nutrition education intervention delivered to children in increasing child fruit and vegetable intake. Authors' conclusions Despite identifying 63 eligible trials of various intervention approaches, the evidence for how to increase children's fruit and vegetable consumption remains limited. There was very low- and low-quality evidence respectively that child-feeding practice and multicomponent interventions may lead to very small increases in fruit and vegetable consumption in children aged five years and younger. It is uncertain whether parent nutrition education interventions are effective in increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in children aged five years and younger. Given that the quality of the evidence is very low or low, future research will likely change estimates and conclusions. Long-term follow-up is required and future research should adopt more rigorous methods to advance the field."
Interventions for indigenous peoples making health decisions: a systematic review	"Background: In general populations, shared decision-making (SDM) facilitates care provider and consumer collaboration for informed health decisions. This study identifies SDM interventions to support Indigenous peoples making health decisions. Methods: A systematic review developed in dialogue with stakeholders using the Cochrane Handbook. A comprehensive search was conducted of electronic databases including all dates to present. Two independent researchers screened and quality appraised included studies. Findings were analyzed descriptively and reported using guidelines for equity focused systematic reviews. Results: Of 1,769 citations screened, 1 study was eligible for inclusion. This study was a randomized control trial rated as low quality for randomization and unclear for the other risk of bias criteria (allocation concealment, performance, detection, attrition, reporting bias). The study was conducted in the US with 44 students ages 11-13, and representative of Pueblo, Navajo, Hopi, and Jicarilla Apache Indian Nations. A culturally relevant tool assessed student decision-making skills before and after intervention. Students demonstrated increased decision-making knowledge and were able to apply a four-step decision-making process to health situations. Conclusions: There is a lack of studies evaluating SDM among Indigenous peoples. One study demonstrated that a culturally relevant approach improved knowledge and application of decision-making skills. Further studies are needed."
Interventions for preventing abuse in the elderly.	"Background Maltreatment of older people (elder abuse) includes psychological, physical, sexual abuse, neglect and financial exploitation. Evidence suggests that 10% of older adults experience some form of abuse, and only a fraction of cases are actually reported or referred to social services agencies. Elder abuse is associated with significant morbidity and premature mortality. Numerous interventions have been implemented to address the issue of elder maltreatment. It is, however, unclear which interventions best serve to prevent or reduce elder abuse. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of primary, secondary and tertiary intervention programmes used to reduce or prevent abuse of the elderly in their own home, in organisational or institutional and community settings. The secondary objective was to investigate whether intervention effects are modified by types of abuse, types of participants, setting of intervention, or the cognitive status of older people. Search methods We searched 19 databases (AgeLine, CINAHL, Psycinfo, MEDLINE, Embase, Proquest Central, Social Services AbstractsLEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK], ASSIA, Sociological Abstracts, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, Web of Science, LILACS, EPPI, InfoBase, CENTRAL, HMIC, Opengrey and Zetoc) on 12 platforms, including multidisciplinary disciplines covering medical, health, social sciences, social services, legal, finance and education. We also browsed related organisational websites, contacted authors of relevant articles and checked reference lists. Searches of databases were conducted between 30 August 2015 and 16 March 2016 and were not restricted by language. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised trials, and quasi-RCTs, before-and-after studies, and interrupted time series. Only studies with at least 12 weeks of follow-up investigating the effect of interventions in preventing or reducing abuse of elderly people and those who interact with the elderly were included. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the studies' risk of bias. Studies were categorised as: 1) education on elder abuse, 2) programmes to reduce factors influencing elder abuse, 3) specific policies for elder abuse, 4) legislation on elder abuse, 5) programmes to increase detection rate on elder abuse, 6) programmes targeted to victims of elder abuse, and 7) rehabilitation programmes for perpetrators of elder abuse. All studies were assessed for study methodology, intervention type, setting, targeted audience, intervention components and intervention intensity. Main results The search and selection process produced seven eligible studies which included a total of 1924 elderly participants and 740 other people. Four of the above seven categories of interventions were evaluated by included studies that varied in study design. Eligible studies of rehabilitation programmes, specific policies for elder abuse and legislation on elder abuse were not found. All included studies contained a control group, with five of the seven studies describing the method of allocation as randomised. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and EPOC assessment criteria to assess risk of bias. The results suggest that risk of bias across the included body of research was high, with at least 40% of the included studies judged as being at high risk of bias. Only one study was judged as having no domains at high risk of bias, with two studies having two of 11 domains at high risk. One study was judged as being at high risk of bias across eight of 11 domains. Authors' conclusions There is inadequate trustworthy evidence to assess the effects of elder abuse interventions on occurrence or recurrence of abuse, although there is some evidence to suggest it may change the combined measure of anxiety and depression of caregivers. There is a need for high-quality trials, including from low- or middle-income countries, with adequate statistical power and appropriate study characteristics to determine whether specific intervention programmes, and which components of these programmes, are effective in preventing or reducing abuse episodes among the elderly. It is uncertain whether the use of educational interventions improves knowledge and attitude of caregivers, and whether such programmes also reduce occurrence of abuse, thus future research is warranted. In addition, all future research should include a component of cost-effectiveness analysis, implementation assessment and equity considerations of the specific interventions under review."
Interventions for promoting booster seat use in four to eight year olds travelling in motor vehicles.	"Background Public health and traffic safety agencies recommend use of booster seats in motor vehicles for children aged four to eight years, and various interventions have been implemented to increase their use by individuals who transport children in motor vehicles. There is little evidence regarding the effectiveness of these interventions, hence the need to examine what works and what does not. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions intended to increase acquisition and use of booster seats in motor vehicles among four to eight year olds. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2005), EMBASE (1980 to April 2005), LILACS, Transport Research Databases (1988 to April 2005), Australian Transport Index (1976 to April 2005), additional databases and reference lists of relevant articles. We also contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria We included randomized and controlled before-and-after trials that investigated the effects of interventions to promote booster seat use. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Main results Five studies involving 3,070 individuals met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. All interventions for promoting use of booster seats among 4 to 8 year olds demonstrated a positive effect (relative risk (RR) 1.43; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.05 to 1.96). Incentives combined with education demonstrated a beneficial effect (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.55; n = 1,898). Distribution of free booster seats combined with education also had a beneficial effect (RR 2.34; 95% CI 1.50 to 3.63; n = 380) as did education-only interventions (RR 1.32; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.49; n = 563). One study which evaluated enforcement of booster seat law met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis, but demonstrated no marked beneficial effect. Authors' conclusions Available evidence suggests that interventions to increase use of booster seats among children age four to eight years are effective. Combining incentives (booster seat discount coupons or gift certificates) or distribution of free booster seats with education demonstrated marked beneficial outcomes for acquisition and use of booster seats for four to eight year olds. There is some evidence of beneficial effect of legislation on acquisition and use of booster seats but this was mainly from uncontrolled before-and-after studies, which did not meet the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis."
Interventions for promoting habitual exercise in people living with and beyond cancer.	"Background This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in the Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9. Despite good evidence for the health benefits of regular exercise for people living with or beyond cancer, understanding how to promote sustainable exercise behaviour change in sedentary cancer survivors, particularly over the long term, is not as well understood. A large majority of people living with or recovering from cancer do not meet current exercise recommendations. Hence, reviewing the evidence on how to promote and sustain exercise behaviour is important for understanding the most effective strategies to ensure benefit in the patient population and identify research gaps. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions designed to promote exercise behaviour in sedentary people living with and beyond cancer and to address the following secondary questions: Which interventions are most effective in improving aerobic fitness and skeletal muscle strength and endurance? Which interventions are most effective in improving exercise behaviour amongst patients with different cancers? Which interventions are most likely to promote long-term (12 months or longer) exercise behaviour? What frequency of contact with exercise professionals and/or healthcare professionals is associated with increased exercise behaviour? What theoretical basis is most often associated with better behavioural outcomes? What behaviour change techniques (BCTs) are most often associated with increased exercise behaviour? What adverse effects are attributed to different exercise interventions? Search methods We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We updated our 2013 Cochrane systematic review by updating the searches of the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, PsycLIT/PsycINFO, SportDiscus and PEDro up to May 2018. We also searched the grey literature, trial registries, wrote to leading experts in the field and searched reference lists of included studies and other related recent systematic reviews. Selection criteria We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared an exercise intervention with usual care or 'waiting list' control in sedentary people over the age of 18 with a homogenous primary cancer diagnosis. Data collection and analysis In the update, review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts to identify studies that might meet the inclusion criteria, or that could not be safely excluded without assessment of the full text (e.g. when no abstract is available). We extracted data from all eligible papers with at least two members of the author team working independently (RT, LS and RG). We coded BCTs according to the CALO-RE taxonomy. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias. When possible, and if appropriate, we performed a fixed-effect meta-analysis of study outcomes. If statistical heterogeneity was noted, a meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. For continuous outcomes (e.g. cardiorespiratory fitness), we extracted the final value, the standard deviation (SD) of the outcome of interest and the number of participants assessed at follow-up in each treatment arm, to estimate the standardised mean difference (SMD) between treatment arms. SMD was used, as investigators used heterogeneous methods to assess individual outcomes. If a meta-analysis was not possible or was not appropriate, we narratively synthesised studies. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach with the GRADE profiler. Main results We included 23 studies in this review, involving a total of 1372 participants (an addition of 10 studies, 724 participants from the original review); 227 full texts were screened in the update and 377 full texts were screened in the original review leaving 35 publications from a total of 23 unique studies included in the review. We planned to include all cancers, but only studies involving breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies incorporated a target level of exercise that could meet current recommendations for moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (i.e.150 minutes per week); or resistance exercise (i.e. strength training exercises at least two days per week). Authors' conclusions Since the last version of this review, none of the new relevant studies have provided additional information to change the conclusions. We have found some improved understanding of how to encourage previously inactive cancer survivors to achieve international physical activity guidelines. Goal setting, setting of graded tasks and instruction of how to perform behaviour, feature in interventions that meet recommendations targets and report adherence of 75% or more. However, long-term follow-up data are still limited, and the majority of studies are in white women with breast cancer. There are still a considerable number of published studies with numerous and varied issues related to high risk of bias and poor reporting standards. Additionally, the meta-analyses were often graded as consisting of low- to very low-certainty evidence. A very small number of serious adverse effects were reported amongst the studies, providing reassurance exercise is safe for this population."
Interventions for promoting participation in shared decision-making for children with cancer	"BACKGROUND: This is an update of the Cochrane systematic review of shared decision-making (SMD) making published in 2013. Children's rights to have their views heard in matters that affect their lives are now well established since the publication of the UN Convention treaty (1989). Children with cancer generally prefer to be involved in decision-making and consider it important that they have the opportunity to take part in decision-making concerning their health care, even in end-of-life decisions. There is considerable support for involving children in healthcare decision-making at a level commensurate with their experience, age and abilities. Thus, healthcare professionals and parents need to know how they should involve children in decision-making and what interventions are most effective in promoting SDM for children with cancer. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of SDM interventions on the process of SDM for children with cancer who are aged four to 18 years. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following sources for the review: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Studies (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 1); PubMed (NLM) (1946 to February 2016); Embase (Ovid) (1974 to February 2016); CINAHL (EBSCO) (1982 to February 2016); ERIC (ProQuest) (1966 to February 2016); PsycINFO (EBSCO) (1806 to February 2016); BIOSIS (Thomson Reuters) (1980 to December 2009 - subscription ceased at that date); ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (1637 to February 2016); and Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest) (1952 to February 2016). In addition we searched the reference lists of relevant articles and review articles and the following conference proceedings (2005 up to and including 2015): American Academy on Communication in Healthcare (AACH), European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), European CanCer Organisation (ECCO), European Association for Communication in Healthcare (EACH), International Conference on Communication in Healthcare (ICCH), International Shared Decision Making Conference (ISDM), Annual Conference of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) and Annual Scientific Meeting of the Society for Medical Decision Making (SMDM). We scanned the ISRCTN (International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number) register and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Register for ongoing trials on 29 February 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: For this update, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of SDM interventions for children with cancer aged four to 18 years. The types of decisions included were: treatment, health care and research participation decisions. The primary outcome was SDM as measured with any validated scale. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors undertook the searches, and three review authors independently assessed the studies obtained. We contacted study authors for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: No studies met the inclusion criteria, and hence no analysis could be undertaken. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No conclusions can be made on the effects of interventions to promote SDM for children with cancer aged four to 18 years. This review has highlighted the dearth of high-quality quantitative research on interventions to promote participation in SDM for children with cancer. There are many potential reasons for the lack of SDM intervention studies with children. Attitudes towards children's participation are slowly changing in society and such changes may take time to be translated or adopted in healthcare settings. The priority may be on developing interventions that promote children's participation in communication interactions since information-sharing is a prerequisite for SDM. Restricting this review to RCTs was a limitation and extending the review to non-randomised studies (NRS) may have produced more evidence. For this update, we included only RCTs and CCTs. Clearly more research is needed."
Interventions for promoting physical activity in people with cystic fibrosis	"BACKGROUND: In individuals with cystic fibrosis there are no established targets for participation in physical activity, nor have any ideal strategies to promote participation in physical activity been identified OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of treatment to increase participation in physical activity in people with cystic fibrosis. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register using the terms 'physiotherapy and exercise'.Date of the most recent search: 05 December 2013.Additionally, we conducted searches of the electronic databases MEDLINE, CINAHL (Ebscohost), PsycINFO (OvidSP) and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). We also searched for potentially relevant, completed but unpublished studies, on several clinical trials registers.Date of the most recent searches: 10 September 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled studies which investigated strategies designed to promote increased participation in daily physical activity for individuals with cystic fibrosis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus, or in arbitration with a third author. MAIN RESULTS: Four studies (199 participants) met the inclusion criteria and were predominantly conducted in children with cystic fibrosis. Only one study had a combined cohort of adult and paediatric participants. The description of study methods was inadequate to assess the risk of bias, particularly with regard to blinding of assessors and selective reporting. One study was conducted in an inpatient setting with follow up in the outpatient setting; while the remaining three studies were conducted in individuals with stable respiratory disease in the outpatient setting. All included studies used exercise training to promote participation in physical activity, with the duration of the intervention period ranging from 18 days to three years. No improvement in physical activity participation was reported with any intervention period less than or equal to six months. Improvements in physical activity participation were only seen where follow up occurred beyond 12 months. There was no significant impact on quality of life from any of the intervention strategies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although participation in physical activity is generally regarded as beneficial for people with cystic fibrosis, there is a lack of evidence regarding strategies to promote the uptake and the continued participation in physical activity for this population. This review provides very limited evidence that activity counselling and exercise advice, undertaken over at least six months, to engage in a home exercise programme may result in improved physical activity participation in people with cystic fibrosis. Further research is needed to determine the effect of strategies such as health coaching or telemedicine applications, in promoting the uptake and adherence to regular participation in physical activity. In addition, establishing the ideal duration of any interventions that promote physical activity, including exercise training programmes, will be important in addressing issues relating to participation in physical activity for people with cystic fibrosis."
Interventions for promoting physical activity.	"Background Little is known about the effectiveness of strategies to enable people to achieve and maintain recommended levels of physical activity. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions designed to promote physical activity in adults aged 16 years and older, not living in an institution. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Library (issue 1 2005), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycLIT, BIDS ISI, SPORTDISCUS, SIGLE, SCISEARCH (from earliest dates available to December 2004). Reference lists of relevant articles were checked. No language restrictions were applied. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials that compared different interventions to encourage sedentary adults not living in an institution to become physically active. Studies required a minimum of six months follow up from the start of the intervention to the collection of final data and either used an intention-to-treat analysis or, failing that, had no more than 20% loss to follow up. Data collection and analysis At least two reviewers independently assessed each study quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information where necessary. Standardised mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for continuous measures of self-reported physical activity and cardio-respiratory fitness. For studies with dichotomous outcomes, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Main results The effect of interventions on self-reported physical activity (19 studies; 7598 participants) was positive and moderate (pooled SMD random effects model 0.28 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41) as was the effect of interventions (11 studies; 2195 participants) on cardio-respiratory fitness (pooled SMD random effects model 0.52 95% CI 0.14 to 0.90). There was significant heterogeneity in the reported effects as well as heterogeneity in characteristics of the interventions. The heterogeneity in reported effects was reduced in higher quality studies, when physical activity was self-directed with some professional guidance and when there was on-going professional support. Authors' conclusions Our review suggests that physical activity interventions have a moderate effect on self-reported physical activity, on achieving a predetermined level of physical activity and cardio-respiratory fitness. Due to the clinical and statistical heterogeneity of the studies, only limited conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of individual components of the interventions. Future studies should provide greater detail of the components of interventions."
Interventions for promoting reintegration and reducing harmful behaviour and lifestyles in street-connected children and young people.	"Background Millions of street-connected children and young people worldwide live or work in street environments. They are vulnerable to many risks, whether or not they remain connected to families of origin, and despite many strengths and resiliencies, they are excluded from mainstream social structures and opportunities. Objectives Search methods We searched the following bibliographic databases, searched for the original review, from inception to 2012, and various relevant non-governmental and organisational websites: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE and Pre-MEDLINE; EMBASE and EMBASE Classic; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); PsycINFO; Education Resource Information Center (ERIC); Sociological Abstracts; Social Services Abstracts; Social Work Abstracts; Healthstar; Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS); System for Grey literature in Europe (OpenGrey); ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; EconLit; IDEAS Economics and Finance Research; JOLIS Library Catalog of the holdings of the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Libraries; British Library for Development Studies (BLDS); Google and Google Scholar. We updated the search in April 2015 for the review update, using the same methods. Selection criteria This review includes data from harm reduction or reintegration intervention studies that used a comparison group study design; all were randomised or quasi-randomised studies. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions provided for street-connected children and young people, from birth to 24 years, in all contexts. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias and other factors presented in the Discussion and Summary quality assessment (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)). We extracted data on intervention delivery, context, process factors, equity and outcomes, and grouped outcomes into psychosocial outcomes, risky sexual behaviours or substance use. We conducted meta-analyses for outcomes where the outcome measures were sufficiently similar. We evaluated other outcomes narratively. Main results We included 13 studies evaluating 19 interventions from high-income countries (HICs). At update stage (from our 2015 search), one previously included study was removed and three new studies added (since our 2012 search). We found no sufficiently robust evaluations conducted in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Study quality overall was low and measurements used by studies variable. Participants were classified as drop-in and shelter-based. No studies measured the primary outcome of reintegration and none reported on adverse effects.We found no consistent results on a range of relevant outcomes within domains of psychosocial health, substance misuse and sexually risky behaviours Interventions evaluated consisted of time-limited therapeutically based programmes that proved no more effective than standard shelter or drop-in services and other control interventions used for most outcomes in most studies. Favourable changes from baseline were reported for outcomes for most participants following therapy interventions and standard services. We noted considerable heterogeneity between studies and inconsistent reporting of equity data. No studies measured the primary outcome of reintegration or reported on adverse effects. Authors' conclusions Analysis revealed no consistently significant benefit for focused therapeutic interventions compared with standard services such as drop-in centres, case management and other comparable interventions for street-connected children and young people. Commonly available services, however, were not rigorously evaluated. Robust evaluation of interventions, including comparison with no intervention, would establish a more reliable evidence base to inform service implementation. More robust research is needed in LMICs to examine interventions for street-connected children and young people with different backgrounds and service needs."
Interventions for shared decision-making about life support in the intensive care unit: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals and families make decisions about the use of life support for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), including decisions to withhold or withdraw life support at the end-of-life. Best practice guidelines recommend using a shared decision-making (SDM) approach to improve the quality of end-of-life decision-making but do not describe how this should be done in practice. AIMS: To know what elements of SDM had been tested to improve communication between healthcare professionals, patients, and their family about the decision. Trials relevant to our review assessed whether these interventions were more effective than usual care. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials of SDM interventions for the decision about using life support, limiting the use of life support, or withdrawing life support for hospitalized patients. We searched databases from inception to January 2011. RESULTS: Of 3,162 publications, four unique trials were conducted between 1992 and 2005. Of four trials, three interventions were evaluated. Two studies of interventions including three of nine elements of SDM did not report improvements in communication. Two studies of the same ethics consultation, which included eight of nine elements of SDM, did not evaluate the benefit to communication. The interventions were not harmful; they decreased family member anxiety and distress, shortened intensive care unit stay, but did not affect patient mortality. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND PRACTICE: Few studies have evaluated interventions to improve communication between healthcare professionals and patients/families when facing the decision about whether or not to use life support in the ICU. Interventions that include essential elements of SDM need to be more thoroughly evaluated in order to determine their effectiveness and health impact and to guide clinical practice.

Interventions for smokeless tobacco use cessation.	"Background Use of smokeless tobacco (ST) can lead to tobacco dependence and long-term use can lead to health problems including periodontal disease, cancer, and cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease. Objectives To assess the effects of behavioural and pharmacologic interventions for the treatment of ST use. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group specialised register in June 2015. Selection criteria Randomized trials of behavioural or pharmacological interventions to help users of ST to quit with follow-up of at least six months. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. We summarised outcomes as risk ratios (RRs). For subgroups of trials with similar types of intervention and without substantial statistical heterogeneity, we estimated pooled effects using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method. Main results We identified 34 trials that met the inclusion criteria, of which nine were new for this update, representing over 16,000 participants. There was moderate quality evidence from two studies suggesting that varenicline increases ST abstinence rates (risk ratio RR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 1.68, 507 participants). Pooled results from two trials of bupropion did not detect a benefit of treatment at six months or longer (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.44, 293 participants) but the confidence interval was wide. Neither nicotine patch (five trials, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.37, 1083 participants) nor nicotine gum (two trials, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43, 310 participants) increased abstinence. Pooling five studies of nicotine lozenges did increase tobacco abstinence (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.59, 1529 participants) but confidence in this estimate is low as the result is sensitive to the exclusion of three trials which did not use a placebo control. Authors' conclusions Varenicline, nicotine lozenges and behavioural interventions may help ST users to quit. Confidence in results for nicotine lozenges is limited. Confidence in the size of effect from behavioural interventions is limited because the components of behavioural interventions that contribute to their impact are not clear."
Interventions for smoking cessation and reduction in individuals with schizophrenia.	"Background Individuals with schizophrenia smoke more heavily than the general population and this contributes to their higher morbidity and mortality from smoking-related illnesses. It remains unclear what interventions can help them to quit or to reduce smoking. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of different treatments for nicotine dependence in schizophrenia. Search methods We searched electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO from inception to October 2012, and the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register in November 2012. Selection criteria We included randomised trials for smoking cessation or reduction, comparing any pharmacological or non-pharmacological intervention with placebo or with another therapeutic control in adult smokers with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility and quality of trials, as well as extracted data. Outcome measures included smoking abstinence, reduction in the amount smoked and any change in mental state. We extracted abstinence and reduction data at the end of treatment and at least six months after the intervention. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence or reduction and biochemically validated data where available. We noted any reported adverse events. Where appropriate, we pooled data using a random-effects model. Main results We included 34 trials (16 trials of cessation; nine trials of reduction; one trial of relapse prevention; eight trials that reported smoking outcomes for interventions aimed at other purposes). Seven trials compared bupropion with placebo; meta-analysis showed that cessation rates after bupropion were significantly higher than placebo at the end of treatment (seven trials, N = 340; risk ratio RR] 3.03; 95% confidence interval CI] 1.69 to 5.42) and after six months (five trials, N = 214, RR 2.78; 95% CI 1.02 to 7.58). There were no significant differences in positive, negative and depressive symptoms between bupropion and placebo groups. There were no reports of major adverse events such as seizures with bupropion. Authors' conclusions Bupropion increases smoking abstinence rates in smokers with schizophrenia, without jeopardizing their mental state. Varenicline may also improve smoking cessation rates in schizophrenia, but its possible psychiatric adverse effects cannot be ruled out. CR may help this group of patients to quit and reduce smoking in the short term. We failed to find convincing evidence that other interventions have a beneficial effect on smoking in schizophrenia."
Interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalised patients.	"Background Smoking contributes to reasons for hospitalisation, and the period of hospitalisation may be a good time to provide help with quitting. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of interventions for smoking cessation that are initiated for hospitalised patients. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group register which includes papers identified from CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO in December 2011 for studies of interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalised patients, using terms including (hospital and patient*) or hospitali* or inpatient* or admission* or admitted. Selection criteria Randomized and quasi-randomized trials of behavioural, pharmacological or multicomponent interventions to help patients stop smoking, conducted with hospitalised patients who were current smokers or recent quitters (defined as having quit more than one month before hospital admission). The intervention had to start in the hospital but could continue after hospital discharge. We excluded studies of patients admitted to facilities that primarily treat psychiatric disorders or substance abuse, studies that did not report abstinence rates and studies with follow-up of less than six months. Both acute care hospitals and rehabilitation hospitals were included in this update, with separate analyses done for each type of hospital. Data collection and analysis Two authors extracted data independently for each paper, with disagreements resolved by consensus. Main results Fifty trials met the inclusion criteria. Intensive counselling interventions that began during the hospital stay and continued with supportive contacts for at least one month after discharge increased smoking cessation rates after discharge (risk ratio (RR) 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 1.48; 25 trials). A specific benefit for post-discharge contact compared with usual care was found in a subset of trials in which all participants received a counselling intervention in the hospital and were randomly assigned to post-discharge contact or usual care. No statistically significant benefit was found for less intensive counselling interventions. Adding nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to an intensive counselling intervention increased smoking cessation rates compared with intensive counselling alone (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.79, six trials). Adding varenicline to intensive counselling had a non-significant effect in two trials (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.74). Adding bupropion did not produce a statistically significant increase in cessation over intensive counselling alone (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.45, three trials). A similar pattern of results was observed in a subgroup of smokers admitted to hospital because of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this subgroup, intensive intervention with follow-up support increased the rate of smoking cessation (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.56), but less intensive interventions did not. One trial of intensive intervention including counselling and pharmacotherapy for smokers admitted with CVD assessed clinical and health care utilization endpoints, and found significant reductions in all-cause mortality and hospital readmission rates over a two-year follow-up period. These trials were all conducted in acute care hospitals. A comparable increase in smoking cessation rates was observed in a separate pooled analysis of intensive counselling interventions in rehabilitation hospitals (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.14, three trials). Authors' conclusions High intensity behavioural interventions that begin during a hospital stay and include at least one month of supportive contact after discharge promote smoking cessation among hospitalised patients. The effect of these interventions was independent of the patient's admitting diagnosis and was found in rehabilitation settings as well as acute care hospitals. There was no evidence of effect for interventions of lower intensity or shorter duration. This update found that adding NRT to intensive counselling significantly increases cessation rates over counselling alone. There is insufficient direct evidence to conclude that adding bupropion or varenicline to intensive counselling increases cessation rates over what is achieved by counselling alone."
Interventions for treating anxiety after stroke	"BACKGROUND: Approximately 20% of stroke patients experience clinically significant levels of anxiety at some point after stroke. Physicians can treat these patients with antidepressants or other anxiety-reducing drugs, or both, or they can provide psychological therapy. This review looks at available evidence for these interventions. This is an update of the review first published in October 2011. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of pharmaceutical, psychological, complementary, or alternative therapeutic interventions in treating stroke patients with anxiety disorders or symptoms. The secondary objective was to identify whether any of these interventions for anxiety had an effect on quality of life, disability, depression, social participation, caregiver burden, or risk of death. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the trials register of the Cochrane Stroke Group (January 2017). We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library; 2017, Issue 1: searched January 2017); MEDLINE (1966 to January 2017) in Ovid; Embase (1980 to January 2017) in Ovid; the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1937 to January 2017) in EBSCO; and PsycINFO (1800 to January 2017) in Ovid. We conducted backward citation searches of reviews identified through database searches and forward citation searches of included studies. We contacted researchers known to be involved in related trials, and we searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised trials including participants with a diagnosis of both stroke and anxiety for which treatment was intended to reduce anxiety. Two review authors independently screened and selected titles and abstracts for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We performed a narrative review. We planned to do a meta-analysis but were unable to do so as included studies were not sufficiently comparable. MAIN RESULTS: We included three trials (four interventions) involving 196 participants with stroke and co-morbid anxiety. One trial (described as a 'pilot study') randomised 21 community-dwelling stroke survivors to four-week use of a relaxation CD or to wait list control. This trial assessed anxiety using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and reported a reduction in anxiety at three months among participants who had used the relaxation CD (mean (standard deviation (SD) 6.9 (+/- 4.9) and 11.0 (+/- 3.9)), Cohen's d = 0.926, P value = 0.001; 19 participants analysed).The second trial randomised 81 participants with co-morbid anxiety and depression to paroxetine, paroxetine plus psychotherapy, or standard care. Mean levels of anxiety severity scores based on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) at follow-up were 5.4 (SD +/- 1.7), 3.8 (SD +/- 1.8), and 12.8 (SD +/- 1.9), respectively (P value < 0.01).The third trial randomised 94 stroke patients, also with co-morbid anxiety and depression, to receive buspirone hydrochloride or standard care. At follow-up, the mean levels of anxiety based on the HAM-A were 6.5 (SD +/- 3.1) and 12.6 (SD +/- 3.4) in the two groups, respectively, which represents a significant difference (P value < 0.01). Half of the participants receiving paroxetine experienced adverse events that included nausea, vomiting, or dizziness; however, only 14% of those receiving buspirone experienced nausea or palpitations. Trial authors provided no information about the duration of symptoms associated with adverse events. The trial of relaxation therapy reported no adverse events.The quality of the evidence was very low. Each study included a small number of participants, particularly the study of relaxation therapy. Studies of pharmacological agents presented details too limited to allow judgement of selection, performance, and detection bias and lack of placebo treatment in control groups. Although the study of relaxation therapy had allocated participants to treatment using an adequate method of randomisation, study recruitment methods might have introduced bias, and drop-outs in the intervention group may have influenced results. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is insufficient to guide the treatment of anxiety after stroke. Further well-conducted randomised controlled trials (using placebo or attention controls) are required to assess pharmacological agents and psychological therapies."
Interventions for treating depression in Muslim Patients: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Religious belief is an important determinant of mental health, depression is the mental illness responsible for the largest disease burden globally, and Islam is the fastest growing world religion. Here we systematically review the literature on the engagement of Muslim patients in the treatment of depression. METHOD: A search of electronic databases, including non-traditional sources, was conducted and content experts were contacted in order to identify qualitative studies, quantitative studies and opinion pieces. A standardised data extraction pro forma and thematic analysis were applied to included studies. RESULTS: 25 studies met the inclusion criteria. Muslims hold many beliefs about depression relevant to its treatment. Advice about how to identify and respond to such beliefs was contradictory and rarely based upon research evidence. The literature is generally of poor quality and rarely distinguishes between religion and culture. LIMITATIONS: Many studies do not distinguish between beliefs and values that are religious and those that are cultural. The majority of papers identified are English language, suggesting that literature from predominantly Muslim countries is underrepresented, despite our strategy of searching for literature from all relevant countries. CONCLUSION: Much of the evidence identified by this review is methodologically weak or includes assertions made without qualification. This evidence provides important perspectives, but should be interpreted with caution. High-quality research is needed to improve our understanding of the treatment of depression in Muslim clients, to determine how existing therapies can be modified to meet the needs of Muslim clients, and to evaluate the effectiveness of such modified therapies.

Interventions for young bereaved children: A systematic review and implications for school mental health providers	"Background: Many young children experience the death of a family member and they may be at risk for developing psychological and behavioral problems, but not much is known about how to help young children cope with such a stressful and painful experience. Objective: The purposes of this study are to identify the interventions for bereaved young children and examine the effectiveness of the interventions. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed to investigate the effects of interventions for preschool-age children (3Äì5 years) who experience the death of a family member. Results: Seventeen studies that met the inclusion criteria for the purpose of this review were identified. All of the studies involved a small sample, and majority of the studies mixed preschool children with other older children in the sample. Play-based therapies were the most common interventions for grieving young children. Involving parents in the interventions, regardless of their therapeutic orientation, was a critical ingredient. Conclusions: Limited empirical evidence of positive intervention outcomes for preschool-age bereaved children was available. Surviving parents were seen as an important agent to help young children grieve and cope with the experience of loss. Implications for school mental health practice and research are provided.

Interventions targeting loneliness and social isolation among the older people: An update systematic review.	"This systematic review aims to summarize and update the current knowledge on the effectiveness of the existing interventions for alleviating loneliness and social isolation among older persons. A search of PubMed, ISI Web of science, SCOPUS, The Cochrane Library, and CINAHL databases was performed. The terminology combined all possible alternatives of the following keywords: social isolation, loneliness, old people, intervention and effectiveness. Eligible studies were published between January 2011 and February 2016 in English or Italian language and regarded the implementation of loneliness/social isolation interventions among the older generations. Outcome measures in terms of the intervention effects needed to be reported. In total, 15 quantitative and five qualitative studies were ultimately included in this review. Eighteen interventions were reported across the quantitative studies. Six out of 11 group interventions (55%), one out of four mixed interventions (25%) and all three individual interventions reported at least one significant finding related to loneliness or social isolation. Our review suggested that new technologies and community engaged arts might be seen as a promising tool for tackling social isolation and loneliness among the older individuals. Future studies need to work on methodological quality and take into consideration the suggestions of the present literature in order to provide firm evidence. Copyright ¬© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Interventions to build resilience in family caregivers of people living with dementia: a comprehensive systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have indicated that family caregivers of people with dementia have higher rates of depression, anxiety and hopelessness, as well as higher levels of burden, stress and distress. Not all caregivers, however, succumb to the negative effects of caring. Caregivers who are able to recover from, resist or adapt to the physical and psychological demands of caring can be considered ""resilient"". OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to examine the existing evidence regarding interventions for building resilience in family caregivers of people living with dementia. INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: This review considered studies that included family caregivers of people with dementia. TYPES OF INTERVENTION(S)/PHENOMENA OF INTEREST: Studies investigating interventions to build resilience in family caregivers were considered by the review. For qualitative studies, the phenomena of interest were family caregivers' experiences of the interventions including factors affecting implementation and their subjective experience of outcomes. CONTEXT: Studies conducted in any cultural or geographical context and any settings including participants' homes in the community, residential aged care or hospital, medical or allied health practice were considered for inclusion. TYPES OF STUDIES: Quantitative studies incorporating experimental and descriptive study designs and qualitative studies, including, but not limited to, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research and feminist research were considered for inclusion. OUTCOMES: Quantitative studies were included that contained either objective or subjective outcome measures (or a combination of both). In cases in which proxy measures of resilience were used, only those papers that explicitly related the aims of the intervention and the measurement of outcomes to resilience itself were considered for inclusion. Proxies could include, but were not limited to, self-efficacy, locus of control, perceived burden, psychological wellbeing, strength, coping, positive adjustment and resourcefulness. Qualitative studies were similarly considered for inclusion if they explicitly related the aims of the intervention to resilience. SEARCH STRATEGY: Eleven electronic databases were searched for research studies published in English in or after 1990. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Quantitative and qualitative studies selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) and Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI). DATA EXTRACTION: Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted from publications included in the review using the standardized data extraction tools from JBI-MAStARI and JBI-QARI. DATA SYNTHESIS: It was not possible to pool quantitative findings for statistical meta-analysis using JBI-MAStARI. Qualitative research findings were too limited to be pooled using the JBI-QARI. The findings are presented in narrative form. RESULTS: The review included three publications reporting one quantitative intervention study and one mixed-method intervention study. There was a lack of available studies and, of the two intervention studies that were identified, neither found any statistically significant change in quantitative measures of resilience. Qualitative data suggested positive impacts of a poetry writing intervention and a positive experience of the intervention. CONCLUSION IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The studies differed in both the nature of the intervention and the way resilience was conceptualized and operationalized. Consequently, it was not possible to offer any recommendations for practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Implications for research relate to the development of a more comprehensive theory of resilience in family caregivers that can be used to develop and rigorously evaluate reliable and valid measures of resilience in line with that theory. Further, well-designed, sufficiently powered intervention studies informed by theory are needed."
Interventions to enhance effective communication during over-the-counter consultations in the community pharmacy setting: A systematic review.	"BACKGROUND: Easy access to effective over-the-counter (OTC) treatments allows self-management of some conditions, however inappropriate or incorrect supply or use of OTC medicines can cause harm. Pharmacy personnel should support consumers in their health-seeking behaviour by utilising effective communication skills underpinned by clinical knowledge. OBJECTIVE: To identify interventions targeted towards improving communication between consumers and pharmacy personnel during OTC consultations in the community pharmacy setting. METHODS: Systematic review and narrative analysis. Databases searched were MEDLINE, EMBASE, Psycinfo, Cochrane Central Register and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for literature published between 2000 and 30 October 2014, as well as reference lists of included articles. The search was re-run on 18 January 2016 and 25 September 2017 to maximise the currency. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved articles for inclusion, assessed study quality and extracted data. Full publications of intervention studies were included. Participants were community pharmacy personnel and/or consumers involved in OTC consultations. Interventions which aimed to improve communication during OTC consultations in the community pharmacy setting were included if they involved a direct measurable communication outcome. Studies reporting attitudes and measures not quantifiable were excluded. The protocol was published on Prospero Database of Systematic Reviews. RESULTS: Of 4978 records identified, 11 studies met inclusion criteria. Interventions evaluated were: face-to-face training sessions (n=10); role-plays (n=9); a software decision making program (n=1); and simulated patient (SP) visits followed by immediate feedback (n=1). Outcomes were measured using: SP methodology (n=10) and a survey (n=1), with most (n=10) reporting a level of improvement in some communication behaviours. CONCLUSION: Empirical evaluation of interventions using active learning techniques such as face-to-face training with role-play can improve some communication skills. However interventions that are not fully described limit the ability for replication and/or generalisability. This review identified interventions targeting pharmacy personnel. Future interventions to improve communication should consider the consumer's role in OTC consultations. Copyright ¬© 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Interventions to enhance informed choices among invitees of screening programmes-a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Informed decision making about participation has become an explicit purpose in invitations for screening programmes in western countries. An informed choice is commonly defined as based on: (i) adequate levels of knowledge of the screening and (ii) agreement between the invitee's values towards own screening participation and actual (intention to) participation. METHODS: We systematically reviewed published studies that empirically evaluated the effects of interventions aiming at enhancing informed decision making in screening programmes targeted at the general population. We focused on prenatal screening and neonatal screening for diseases of the foetus/new-born and screening for breast cancer, cervical cancer and colorectal cancer. The Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched for studies published till April 2012, using the terms 'informed choice', 'decision making' and 'mass screening' separately and in combination and terms referring to the specific screening programmes. RESULTS: Of the 2238 titles identified, 15 studies were included, which evaluated decision aids (DAs), information leaflets, film, video, counselling and a specific screening visit for informed decision making in prenatal screening, breast and colorectal cancer screening. Most of the included studies evaluated DAs and showed improved knowledge and informed decision making. Due to the limited number of studies the results could not be synthesized. CONCLUSION: The empirical evidence regarding interventions to improve informed decision making in screening is limited. It is unknown which strategies to enhance informed decision making are most effective, although DAs are promising. Systematic development of interventions to enhance informed choices in screening deserves priority, especially in disadvantaged groups. Copyright ¬© The Author 2014.

Interventions to facilitate shared decision making to address antibiotic use for acute respiratory infections in primary care.	"Background Shared decision making is an important component of patient-centred care. It is a set of communication and evidence-based practice skills that elicits patients' expectations, clarifies any misperceptions and discusses the best available evidence for benefits and harms of treatment. Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are one of the most common reasons for consulting in primary care and obtaining prescriptions for antibiotics. However, antibiotics offer few benefits for ARIs, and their excessive use contributes to antibiotic resistance - an evolving public health crisis. Greater explicit consideration of the benefit-harm trade-off within shared decision making may reduce antibiotic prescribing for ARIs in primary care. Objectives To assess whether interventions that aim to facilitate shared decision making increase or reduce antibiotic prescribing for ARIs in primary care. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November week 3, 2014), EMBASE (2010 to December 2014) and Web of Science (1985 to December 2014). We searched for other published, unpublished or ongoing trials by searching bibliographies of published articles, personal communication with key trial authors and content experts, and by searching trial registries at the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (individual level or cluster-randomised), which evaluated the effectiveness of interventions that promote shared decision making (as the focus or a component of the intervention) about antibiotic prescribing for ARIs in primary care. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted and collected data. Antibiotic prescribing was the primary outcome, and secondary outcomes included clinically important adverse endpoints (e.g. re-consultations, hospital admissions, mortality) and process measures (e.g. patient satisfaction). We assessed the risk of bias of all included trials and the quality of evidence. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing information where available. Main results We identified 10 published reports of nine original RCTs (one report was a long-term follow-up of the original trial) in over 1100 primary care doctors and around 492,000 patients. Authors' conclusions Interventions that aim to facilitate shared decision making reduce antibiotic prescribing in primary care in the short term. Effects on longer-term rates of prescribing are uncertain and more evidence is needed to determine how any sustained reduction in antibiotic prescribing affects hospital admission, pneumonia and death."
Interventions to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy in children with HIV infection.	"Background Achieving and maintaining high levels of medication adherence are required to achieve the full benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART), yet suboptimal adherence among children is common in both developed and developing countries. Objectives To conduct a systematic review of the literature of evaluations of interventions for improving paediatric ART adherence. Search methods We created a comprehensive search strategy in order to identify all studies relevant to this topic. In July 2010, we searched the following electronic databases: EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, Web of Social Science, NLM Gateway (supplemented by a manual search of the most recent abstracts not included in the Gateway database). We searched abstracts from the International AIDS Conference from 2002 to 2010, the International AIDS Society Conference on Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention from 2003 to 2009, and from the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections from 1997 to 2010. We used search strategies determined by the Cochrane Review Group on HIV/AIDS. We also contacted researchers who work in this field and checked reference lists of related systematic reviews and of all included studies. Selection criteria Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials of interventions to improve adherence to ART among children and adolescents (age 80% adherence was no different between children on a lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/r) regimen compared to children on a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase regimen (p=.781). However, the proportion of children achieving virological suppression was significantly greater for children on the LPV/r regimen than for children on the NNRTI-containing regimen (p=.002). Authors' conclusions A home-based nursing intervention has the potential to improve ART adherence, but more evidence is needed. Medication diaries do not appear to have an effect on adherence or disease outcomes. Two interventions, an LPV/r-containing regimen and peer support therapy for adolescents, did not demonstrate improvements in adherence, yet demonstrated greater viral load suppression compared to control groups, suggesting a different mechanism for improved health outcomes. Well-designed evaluations of interventions to improve paediatric adherence to ART are needed."
Interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices for hospital inpatients.	"Background Antibiotic resistance is a major public health problem. Infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria are associated with prolonged hospital stay and death compared with infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Appropriate antibiotic use in hospitals should ensure effective treatment of patients with infection and reduce unnecessary prescriptions. We updated this systematic review to evaluate the impact of interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing to hospital inpatients. Objectives To estimate the effectiveness and safety of interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing to hospital inpatients and to investigate the effect of two intervention functions: restriction and enablement. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, and Embase. We searched for additional studies using the bibliographies of included articles and personal files. The last search from which records were evaluated and any studies identified incorporated into the review was January 2015. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies (NRS). We included three non-randomised study designs to measure behavioural and clinical outcomes and analyse variation in the effects: non- randomised trials (NRT), controlled before-after (CBA) studies and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. For this update we also included three additional NRS designs (case control, cohort, and qualitative studies) to identify unintended consequences. Interventions included any professional or structural interventions as defined by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group. We defined restriction as 'using rules to reduce the opportunity to engage in the target behaviour (or increase the target behaviour by reducing the opportunity to engage in competing behaviours)'. We defined enablement as 'increasing means/reducing barriers to increase capability or opportunity'. The main comparison was between intervention and no intervention. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data and assessed study risk of bias. We performed meta-analysis and meta-regression of RCTs and meta-regression of ITS studies. We classified behaviour change functions for all interventions in the review, including those studies in the previously published versions. We analysed dichotomous data with a risk difference (RD). We assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE criteria. Main results This review includes 221 studies (58 RCTs, and 163 NRS). Most studies were from North America (96) or Europe (87). The remaining studies were from Asia (19), South America (8), Australia (8), and the East Asia (3). Although 62% of RCTs were at a high risk of bias, the results for the main review outcomes were similar when we restricted the analysis to studies at low risk of bias. Authors' conclusions We found high-certainty evidence that interventions are effective in increasing compliance with antibiotic policy and reducing duration of antibiotic treatment. Lower use of antibiotics probably does not increase mortality and likely reduces length of stay. Additional trials comparing antibiotic stewardship with no intervention are unlikely to change our conclusions. Enablement consistently increased the effect of interventions, including those with a restrictive component. Although feedback further increased intervention effect, it was used in only a minority of enabling interventions. Interventions were successful in safely reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in hospitals, despite the fact that the majority did not use the most effective behaviour change techniques. Consequently, effective dissemination of our findings could have considerable health service and policy impact. Future research should instead focus on targeting treatment and assessing other measures of patient safety, assess different stewardship interventions, and explore the barriers and facilitators to implementation. More research is required on unintended consequences of restrictive interventions."
Interventions to improve insulin prescribing practice for people with diabetes in hospital: a systematic review.	"AIM: To conduct a systematic review of literature to identify interventions that are effective in improving insulin prescribing for people with diabetes in the hospital setting. METHODS: Computerized bibliographic databases were searched for studies published in English that described the effectiveness of interventions to improve insulin prescribing within the hospital setting. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported data that compared insulin prescribing practice after an intervention or compared with a control group. Studies were not excluded on the basis of publication date, geographical location or risk of bias assessment. RESULTS: We identified 35 studies for inclusion in the review, including two cluster randomized controlled trials, two cohort studies, and 31 uncontrolled before-after studies. Studies reported a variety of interventions that aimed to increase insulin prescribing accuracy or completeness or decrease the use of discouraged subcutaneous sliding scale insulin regimens. Differences in definition of insulin prescribing error, terminology and common practice based on geographical location was evident, and quality issues with respect to study design and reporting somewhat limited the interpretation of conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing strategies that are sensitive to local context and designed to increase adherence to insulin prescribing guidelines are associated with a reduction in prescribing errors. Future implementation should build on effective approaches including multifaceted interventions involving multiple stakeholders at various institutional levels. Future studies in insulin prescribing errors would benefit from the use of standardized approaches, terminology and outcome measures to enable greater comparison.

Interventions to Increase Depression Treatment Initiation in Primary Care Patients: a Systematic Review.	"INTRODUCTION: Nearly 50% of depressed primary care patients referred to mental health services do not initiate mental health treatment. The most promising interventions for increasing depression treatment initiation in primary care settings remain unclear. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of publicly available databases from inception through August 2017 to identify interventions designed to increase depression treatment initiation. Two authors independently selected, extracted data, and rated risk of bias from included studies. Eligible studies used a randomized or pre-post design and assessed depression treatment initiation (i.e., >= 1 mental health visit or antidepressant fill) among adults, the majority of whom met criteria for depression. Interventions were classified as simple or complex and sub-classified into intervention strategies that were graded for strength of evidence. RESULTS: Of 9516 articles identified, we included 14 unique studies representing 16 (4 simple and 12 complex) interventions and 8 treatment initiation strategies. We found low to moderate strength of evidence for collaborative/integrated care (3 studies), treatment preference matching (2 studies), and case management (2 studies) strategies. However, there was insufficient evidence to determine the benefit of cultural tailoring (2 studies), motivation (alone, with reminders or with cultural tailoring (5 studies)), education (1 study), and shared decision-making strategies (1 study). Overall, we found moderate strength of evidence for complex interventions (8 of 12 complex interventions demonstrated statistically significant effects on treatment initiation). DISCUSSION: Collaborative/integrated care, preference treatment matching, and case management strategies had the best evidence for improving depression treatment initiation, but none of the strategies had high strength of evidence. While primary care settings can consider using some of these strategies when referring depressed patients to treatment, our review highlights the need for further rigorous research in this area."
Interventions to optimise prescribing for older people in care homes.	"Background There is a substantial body of evidence that prescribing for care home residents is suboptimal and requires improvement. Consequently, there is a need to identify effective interventions to optimise prescribing and resident outcomes in this context. This is an update of a previously published review (). Objectives The objective of the review was to determine the effect of interventions to optimise overall prescribing for older people living in care homes. Search methods For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Specialised Register), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL to May 2015. We also searched clinical trial registries for relevant studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials evaluating interventions aimed at optimising prescribing for older people (aged 65 years or older) living in institutionalised care facilities. Studies were included if they measured one or more of the following primary outcomes: adverse drug events; hospital admissions; mortality; or secondary outcomes, quality of life (using validated instrument); medication-related problems; medication appropriateness (using validated instrument); medicine costs. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, assessed studies for eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We presented a narrative summary of results. Main results The 12 included studies involved 10,953 residents in 355 (range 1 to 85) care homes in ten countries. Nine studies were cluster-randomised controlled trials and three studies were patient-randomised controlled trials. The interventions evaluated were diverse and often multifaceted. Medication review was a component of ten studies. Four studies involved multidisciplinary case-conferencing, five studies involved an educational element for health and care professionals and one study evaluated the use of clinical decision support technology. We did not combine the results in a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity across studies. Interventions to optimise prescribing may lead to fewer days in hospital (one study out of eight; low certainty evidence), a slower decline in health-related quality of life (one study out of two; low certainty evidence), the identification and resolution of medication-related problems (seven studies; low certainty evidence), and may lead to improved medication appropriateness (five studies out of five studies; low certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether the intervention improves/reduces medicine costs (five studies; very low certainty evidence) and it may make little or no difference on adverse drug events (two studies; low certainty evidence) or mortality (six studies; low certainty evidence). The risk of bias across studies was heterogeneous. Authors' conclusions We could not draw robust conclusions from the evidence due to variability in design, interventions, outcomes and results. The interventions implemented in the studies in this review led to the identification and resolution of medication-related problems and improvements in medication appropriateness, however evidence of a consistent effect on resident-related outcomes was not found. There is a need for high-quality cluster-randomised controlled trials testing clinical decision support systems and multidisciplinary interventions that measure well-defined, important resident-related outcomes."
Interventions to promote long-term participation in physical activity after stroke: A systematic review of the literature.	"Objective To investigate the effects of interventions to promote long-term participation in physical activity (PA) on measures of frequency, duration, or intensity of PA at 3 months or longer in community-dwelling stroke survivors. Data Sources MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews between 1987 and December 2012. Search terms included ""physical activity, exercise promotion,"" ""stroke,"" ""behavior change interventions,"" and their synonyms. Study Selection Randomized controlled trials or comparison studies involving stroke survivors, with follow-up of >3 months, examining interventions to increase long-term participation in PA. Data Extraction Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines informed data extraction. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Two reviewers independently reviewed abstracts and extracted data. Data Synthesis Of 2888 studies, 11 involving 1704 participants were included. Risk of bias occurred in randomization methods and blinding. Limited data and study heterogeneity meant that data pooling was not possible. Odds ratios and continuous data as weighted mean differences, however, were calculated using fixed-effect models and 95% confidence intervals. Two intervention types were identified: individualized tailored counseling with or without supervised exercise (n=6 studies) and supervised exercise with advice (n=5 studies). Three studies illustrated increased odds of meeting recommended PA levels and participation in PA at 12 months after tailored counseling (P<.05). Two studies showed improved step count at 3 months with supervised exercise only (P<.05); however, PA levels had declined by 3 months. Tailored home exercise was the only predominantly exercise-based intervention to demonstrate higher PA participation at 12 months. Conclusions This study provides some evidence that tailored counseling alone or with tailored supervised exercise improves long-term PA participation and functional exercise capacity after stroke better than does tailored supervised exercise with general advice only. Interventions to improve participation in PA should incorporate PA-specific tailored counseling based on sound behavioral theory to promote long-term participation in PA. ¬© 2014 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine."
Interventions to support children's engagement in health-related decisions: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Children often need support in health decision-making. The objective of this study was to review characteristics and effectiveness of interventions that support health decision-making of children. METHODS: A systematic review. Electronic databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, CINAHL, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and EMBASE) were searched from inception until March 2012. Two independent reviewers screened eligibility: a) intervention studies; b) involved supporting children (<=18 years) considering health-related decision(s); and c) measured decision quality or decision-making process outcomes. Data extraction and quality appraisal were conducted by one author and verified by another using a standardized data extraction form. Quality appraisal was based on the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS: Of 4313 citations, 5 studies were eligible. Interventions focused on supporting decisions about risk behaviors (n = 3), psycho-educational services (n = 1), and end of life (n = 1). Two of 5 studies had statistically significant findings: i) compared to attention placebo, decision coaching alone increased values congruence between child and parent, and child satisfaction with decision-making process (lower risk of bias); ii) compared to no intervention, a workshop with weekly assignments increased overall decision-making quality (higher risk of bias). CONCLUSIONS: Few studies have focused on interventions to support children's participation in decisions about their health. More research is needed to determine effective methods for supporting children's health decision-making."
Interventions to support shared decision making for hypertension: A systematic review of controlled studies.	"BACKGROUND: Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a common long-term health condition. Patient involvement in treating and monitoring hypertension is essential. Control of hypertension improves population cardiovascular outcomes. However, for an individual, potential benefits and harms of treatment are finely balanced. Shared decision making has the potential to align decisions with the preferences and values of patients. OBJECTIVE: Determine the effectiveness of interventions to support shared decision making in hypertension. SEARCH STRATEGY: Searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and PsycINFO up to 30 September 2017. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Controlled studies evaluating the effects of shared decision-making interventions for adults with hypertension compared with any comparator in any setting and reporting any outcome measures. RESULTS: Six studies (five randomized controlled trials) in European primary care were included. Main intervention components were as follows: training for health-care professionals, decision aids, patient coaching and a patient leaflet. Four studies, none at low risk of bias, reported a measure of shared decision making; the intervention increased shared decision making in one study. Four studies reported blood pressure between 6 months and 3 years after the intervention; there was no difference in blood pressure between intervention and control groups in any study. Lack of comparability between studies prevented meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite widespread calls for shared decision making to be embedded in health care, there is little evidence to inform shared decision making for hypertension, one of the most common conditions managed in primary care.

Interventions to support shared decision-making for women with heavy menstrual bleeding: A systematic review	"This review studies women's preferences for shared decision-making about heavy menstrual bleeding treatment and evaluates interventions that support shared decision-making and their effectiveness. PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Medline and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched. Three research questions were predefined: 1) What is the range of perspectives gathered in studies that examine women facing a decision related to heavy menstrual bleeding management?; 2) What types of interventions have been developed to support shared decision-making for women experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding?; and 3) In what way might women benefit from interventions that support shared decision-making? All original studies were included if the study population consisted of women experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding. We used the TIDieR (Template for Intervention: Description and Replication) checklist to assess the quality of description and the reproducibility of interventions. Interventions were categorized using Grande et al. guidelines and collated and summarized outcomes measures into three categories: 1) patient-reported outcomes; 2) observer-reported outcomes; and 3) doctor-reported outcomes. Fifteen studies were included. Overall, patients preferred to decide together with their doctor (74%). Women's previsit preference was the strongest predictor for treatment choice in two studies. Information packages did not have a statistically significant effect on treatment choice or satisfaction. However, adding a structured interview or decision aid to increase patient involvement did show a positive effect on treatment choice and results, patient satisfaction and shared decision-making related outcomes. In conclusion shared decision-making is becoming more important in the care of women with heavy menstrual bleeding. Structured interviews or well-designed (computerized) tools such as decision aids seem to facilitate this process, but there is room for improvement. A shared treatment choice is only possible after careful provision of information, elicitation of patients' preferences and integrating those preferences. Interventions should be designed accordingly. Copyright ¬© 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Interventions to treat mental disorders during pregnancy: A systematic review and multiple treatment meta-analysis.	"BACKGROUND: For women suffering from an antepartum mental disorder (AMD), there is lack of evidence-based treatment algorithms due to the complicated risk-benefit analysis for both mother and unborn child. We aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to treat AMD and performed a meta-analysis of the estimated treatment effect on the psychiatric symptoms during pregnancy. METHODS: MedLine, PsycINFO and Embase databases were searched by two independent reviewers for clinical trials with a control condition on treatment of women with AMD, i.e. major depressive (MDD), anxiety, psychotic, eating, somatoform and personality disorders. We inventoried the effect of the treatment, i.e. decrease of psychiatric symptoms at the end of the treatment or postpartum. We adhered to the PRISMA-protocol. FINDINGS: Twenty-nine trials were found involving 2779 patients. Trials studied patients with depressive disorders (k = 28), and anxiety disorders (k = 1). No pharmacological trials were detected. A form of psychotherapy, like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (g = -0.61; 95%CI:-0.73 to -0.49, I2 = 0%; k = 7) or Interpersonal Psychotherapy (g = -0.67; 95%CI:-1.27 to -0.07; I2 = 79%; k = 4), holds robust benefit for pregnant women with MDD. Body-oriented interventions (g = -0.43; 95%CI:-0.61 to -0.25; I2 = 17%; k = 7) and acupuncture (g = -0.43; 95%CI:-0.80 to -0.06; I2 = 0%; k = 2) showed medium sized reduction of depressive symptoms. Bright light therapy (g = -0.59; 95%CI:-1.25 to 0.06; I2 = 0%; k = 2), and food supplements (g = -0.51; 95%CI:-1.02 to 0.01; I2 = 20%; k = 3) did not show significant treatment effects. One study was found on Integrative Collaborative Care. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis found a robust moderate treatment effect of CBT for MDD during pregnancy, and to a lesser extent for IPT. As an alternative, positive results were found for body-oriented interventions and acupuncture. No evidence was found for bright light therapy and food supplements. Only non-pharmacological trials on women with MDD were found. Research on a wider range of AMD is needed."
Interventions using social networking sites to promote contraception in women of reproductive age.	"Background Social networking sites (SNSs) have great potential as a platform for public health interventions to address the unmet need for contraception. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions using SNSs to promote the uptake of and adherence to contraception in reproductive-age women. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and six other databases on January 2018. We also searched Google Scholar, key conference proceedings, checked the reference lists of included studies, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised interventional studies (NRS) in women of reproductive age. SNSs requiring a social profile within a bounded or restricted-access system of shared connections were included. We also included trials that utilised SNSs only or as an adjunct to an intervention. Studies had to have a follow-up outcome assessment of at least three months. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full-text studies, and extracted data from included studies. A third author was assigned to arbitrate areas of disagreement. Authors assessed risk of bias according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We were unable to conduct a meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity of the study designs and outcome measures. Main results Of the 461 unique records found, only two studies met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were conducted in the USA and were at high risk of bias. One RCT included 2284 women exposed to a web-based SNS or nothing. The groups were no different post intervention in their self-reported consistency of contraceptive use or knowledge of the relative effectiveness of different methods. There was a small but significant increase in the use of more effective methods (long-acting reversible methods) at 12 months' follow-up. Authors' conclusions Despite the prevalence of SNSs, we found little scientific evidence to support the use of SNSs to improve contraceptive use or adherence among women."
Intimate partner violence screening in emergency department: a rapid review of the literature	"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of the review was to identify intimate partner violence screening interventions used in emergency departments and to explore factors affecting intimate partner violence screening in emergency departments. BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence against women is now clearly recognised as a global health and societal issue. Nurses working in emergency and urgent care settings can play a crucial role in identification, prevention and management of intimate partner violence. Research exploring optimal methods of intimate partner violence screening and factors affecting intimate partner violence screening in emergency departments are relatively limited. DESIGN: Literature review: Rapid Evidence Synthesis. METHODS: Literature published between 2000-2015 was reviewed using the principles of rapid evidence assessment. Six electronic databases: CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Psych Info, the Cochrane Library and Joanna Briggs Library. RESULTS: Twenty-nine empirical studies meeting the eligibility criteria were independently assessed by two authors using appropriate Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Checklists. Intimate partner violence screening in emergency departments is usually performed using electronic, face to face or pen- and paper-based instruments. Routine or universal screening results in higher identification rates of intimate partner violence. Women who screen positive for intimate partner violence in emergency departments are more likely to experience abuse in subsequent months. Factors that facilitate partner violence screening can be classified as healthcare professionals related factors, organisational factors and patient-related factors. CONCLUSIONS: Emergency departments provide a unique opportunity for healthcare professionals to screen patients for intimate partner violence. Competence in assessing the needs of the patients appears to be a very significant factor that may affect rates of intimate partner violence disclosure. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Knowledge of appropriate domestic violence screening methods and factors affecting intimate partner violence screening in emergency can help nurses, and other healthcare professionals provide patient-centred and effective care to victims of abuse attending emergency department.

Intrinsic or Extrinsic? Using Videogames to Motivate Stroke Survivors: A Systematic Review	"OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to explore, via a systematic review of available literature, the effectiveness of videogame-based rehabilitation interventions on the motivation and health outcomes of stroke patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a systematic literature review of 18 articles, we sought to address three key research questions: (1) Do videogames improve function or health outcomes among stroke survivors? (2) Do videogames increase stroke patients' motivation to engage in rehabilitation exercise and activities? (3) Which motivational techniques, principles, and theoretical frameworks have been applied in the reviewed studies? A key word search was conducted, and articles were coded for inclusion of motivational theories or principles, intervention effectiveness, and participants' motivation to perform tasks. Three motivational frameworks and principles were used (self-determination theory SDT], flow theory, and operant conditioning) to investigate intrinsic and extrinsic approaches. RESULTS: Past research suggests videogame-based interventions are effective at improving and increasing a variety of health-related outcomes, including motor functioning, energy expenditure, muscle strength, and recovery times in stroke patients. CONCLUSIONS: Past evidence shows videogame-based interventions are a promising tool to motivate stroke patients' engagement in effective rehabilitation activities. This study also identifies an opportunity for future research to apply motivational theories from SDT to studies on stroke rehabilitation and videogames."
Involving patients in patient safety programmes: A scoping review and consensus procedure by the LINNEAUS collaboration on patient safety in primary care	"BACKGROUND: Patient involvement has only recently received attention as a potentially useful approach to patient safety in primary care. OBJECTIVE: To summarize work conducted on a scoping review of interventions focussing on patient involvement for patient safety; to develop consensus-based recommendations in this area. METHODS: Scoping review of the literature 2006-2011 about methods and effects of involving patients in patient safety in primary care identified evidence for previous experiences of patient involvement in patient safety. This information was fed back to an expert panel for the development of recommendations for healthcare professionals and policy makers. RESULTS: The scoping review identified only weak evidence in support of the effectiveness of patient involvement. Identified barriers included a number of patient factors but also the healthcare workers' attitudes, abilities and lack of training. The expert panel recommended the integration of patient safety in the educational curricula for healthcare professionals, and expected a commitment from professionals to act as first movers by inviting and encouraging the patients to take an active role. The panel proposed a checklist to be used by primary care clinicians at the point of care for promoting patient involvement. CONCLUSION: There is only weak evidence on the effectiveness of patient involvement in patient safety. The recommendations of the panel can inform future policy and practice on patient involvement in safety in primary care."
Involving patients in quality indicator development - a systematic review.	"BACKGROUND: Quality indicators (QI) are used in many health care areas to measure, compare, and improve the quality of care. Ideas of quality differ between health care providers and patients, yet patients are not regularly involved in QI development nor does a methodological standard for patient involvement in QI development exist. In this study we systematically reviewed the medical journal articles and gray literature for published approaches for involving patients in QI development. METHODS: We searched medical literature databases (Medline, Excerpta Medica database, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), screened websites, and contacted experts in the field of QI development for publications on approaches to patient involvement in QI development. RESULTS: Eleven relevant journal articles and four web-published documents were included. Four major approaches to patient involvement were extracted from the literature: (1) focus group interviews, (2) self-administered questionnaires, (3) individual interviews, and (4) participation in panels during systematic consensus processes. Patients' views were collected by involving patients, patient representatives, or family members. CONCLUSION: Although there is a large body of literature on QI, publications that describe approaches to patient involvement in QI development are scarce. In principle, indirect and direct methods of patient involvement can be distinguished, and it seems most promising to combine different approaches. However, the limited number of publications identified clearly shows that further research in this field is overdue and that the quality of reporting found in studies within this field needs to be improved."
Involving patients in reducing decision uncertainties around orphan and ultra-orphan drugs: a rare opportunity?	"INTRODUCTION: Uncertainty influences the amount of risk in decision making, and is typically related to clinical benefit, value for money, affordability, and/or adoption/diffusion of the technology (e.g., drug, device, procedure, etc.). Although evidence-based review processes within each stage of the technology lifecycle have been implemented to minimize uncertainty, high-quality information addressing that related to orphan and ultra-orphan drugs is often unavailable. The role that patients, as experts in their disease, may play in providing such information has yet to be fully explored. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to identify existing and proposed opportunities for patients with rare diseases and their families to provide input aimed at reducing decision uncertainties throughout the lifecycle of an orphan or ultra-orphan drug. METHODS: A comprehensive review of published and gray literature describing roles for patients and families in activities related to orphan and ultra-orphan drugs was conducted. In addition, the websites of regulatory and centralized reimbursement decision-making bodies in the top 22 OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries by gross domestic product (GDP) were scanned to identify current opportunities for patients with rare diseases in both stages. The websites of umbrella patient organizations for rare diseases in these countries were also scanned. These roles were then mapped onto a matrix to determine the stage in the technology lifecycle and types of uncertainties they directly or indirectly addressed. RESULTS: Across the 22 countries, nine roles for patients within regulatory related processes were identified, with at least one in each country. These roles were not specific to patients with rare diseases. Similarly, six different opportunities for patient input in centralized drug review processes were identified, all of which applied to patients, in general, rather than just those with rare diseases. 'Real-world' examples of patient involvement explicitly related to rare diseases centered around 11 different themes. Seven fell within the research and development or clinical trial stages of a drug's lifecycle. Of the remaining four, three were associated with education and advocacy. All of the proposed roles identified focused on greater involvement in (1) the design and conduct of clinical trials, or (2) the 'valuation' of evidence during reimbursement decision making. When mapped onto the matrix of decision uncertainties, almost all of the existing and proposed roles addressed 'clinical benefit'. Roles for patients in reducing 'value for money', affordability, or adoption/diffusion uncertainties were mainly indirect, and a result of patient involvement in activities aimed at generating information on clinical benefit, which is then used to inform discussions around these uncertainties. CONCLUSIONS: While patient involvement in activities that directly address uncertainties in clinical benefit may not be 'rare', opportunities for reducing those related to 'value for money', affordability, and adoption/diffusion remain scarce."
Is Acupuncture Effective for Improving Insulin Resistance? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	"This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of acupuncture for intervening insulin resistance (IR) by meta-analysis of related randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Studies published prior to 31 January 2018 were searched on Pubmed, Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase databases and Chinese databases. Only RCTs, which examined acupuncture as the sole or adjunctive treatment for IR-related diseases, were included. The primary outcome was homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The secondary outcomes consisted of fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS) and 2-h postprandial blood glucose (2h-PBG). The differences between groups were reported as mean differences (MD). All statistical analyses were performed using RevMan software 5.3. After carefully screening relevant studies, 9 RCTs involving 562 patients (279 in experimental group and 283 in control group) were enrolled in this study. The pooled results showed that acupuncture had significant effects on HOMA-IR (MD 0.70, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.35, P=0.040.05). The present meta-analysis indicated that acupuncture can help to improve IR to a certain extent, which remains to be confirmed by further high-quality RCTs."
Is body-weight-supported treadmill training or robotic-assisted gait training superior to overground gait training and other forms of physiotherapy in people with spinal cord injury? A systematic review	"STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review about randomised trials comparing different training strategies to improve gait in people with spinal cord injuries (SCI). OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review was to compare the effectiveness of body-weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) and robotic-assisted gait training with overground gait training and other forms of physiotherapy in people with traumatic SCI. SETTING: Systematic review conducted by researchers from Germany and Australia. METHODS: An extensive search was conducted for randomised controlled trials involving people with traumatic SCI that compared either BWSTT or robotic-assisted gait training with overground gait training and other forms of physiotherapy. The two outcomes of interest were walking speed (m s-1) and walking distance (m). BWSTT and robotic-assisted gait training were analysed separately, and data were pooled across trials to derive mean between-group differences using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Thirteen randomised controlled trials involving 586 people were identified. Ten trials involving 462 participants compared BWSTT to overground gait training and other forms of physiotherapy, but only nine trials provided useable data. The pooled mean (95% confidence interval (CI)) between-group differences for walking speed and walking distance were -0.03 m s-1 (-0.10 to 0.04) and -7 m (-45 to 31), respectively, favouring overground gait training. Five trials involving 344 participants compared robotic-assisted gait training to overground gait training and other forms of physiotherapy but only three provided useable data. The pooled mean (95% CI) between-group differences for walking speed and walking distance were -0.04 m s-1 (95% CI -0.21 to 0.13) and -6 m (95% CI -86 to 74), respectively, favouring overground gait training. CONCLUSIONS: BWSTT and robotic-assisted gait training do not increase walking speed more than overground gait training and other forms of physiotherapy do, but their effects on walking distance are not clear."
Is Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR) Useful? A Systematic Review on Papers in a Decade.	"BACKGROUND: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) has been applied by health researchers and practitioners to address health disparities and community empowerment for health promotion. Despite the growing popularity of CBPR projects, there has been little effort to synthesize the literature to evaluate CBPR projects. The present review attempts to identify appropriate elements that may contribute to the successful or unsuccessful interventions. METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken using evidence identified through searching electronic databases, web sites, and reference list checks. Predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria were assessed by reviewers. Levels of evidence, accounting for methodologic quality, were assessed for 3 types of CBPR approaches, including interventional, observational, and qualitative research design as well as CBPR elements through separate abstraction forms. Each included study was appraised with 2 quality grades, one for the elements of CBPR and one for research design. RESULTS: Of 14,222 identified articles, 403 included in the abstract review. Of these, 70 CBPR studies, that 56 intervention studies had different designs, and finally 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings show that collaboration among community partners, researchers, and organizations led to community-level action to improve the health and wellbeing and to minimize health disparities. It enhanced the capacity of the community in terms of research and leadership skills. The result provided examples of effective CBPR that took place in a variety of communities. However, little has been written about the organizational capacities required to make these efforts successful. CONCLUSION: Some evidences were found for potentially effective strategies to increase the participant's levels of CBPR activities. Interventions that included community involvement have the potential to make important differences to levels of activities and should be promoted."
"Is patient empowerment the key to promote adherence? A systematic review of the relationship between self-efficacy, health locus of control and medication adherence"	"BACKGROUND: Current health policies emphasize the need for an equitable doctor-patient relationship, and this requires a certain level of patient empowerment. However, a systematic review of the empirical evidence on how empowerment affects medication adherence-the extent to which patients follow the physician's prescription of medication intake-is still missing. The goal of this systematic review is to sum up current state-of-the-art knowledge concerning the relationship between patient empowerment and medication adherence across medical conditions. As our conceptualization defines health locus of control and self-efficacy as being crucial components of empowerment, we explored the relationship between these two constructs and medication adherence. METHODS: Relevant studies were retrieved through a comprehensive search of Medline and PsychINFO databases (1967 to 2017). In total, 4903 publications were identified. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria and quality assessment, 154 articles were deemed relevant. Peer-reviewed articles, written in English, addressing the relationship between empowerment (predictor) and medication adherence (outcome) were included. FINDINGS: High levels of self-efficacy and Internal Health Locus of Control are consistently found to promote medication adherence. External control dimensions were found to have mainly negative (Chance and God attributed control beliefs) or ambiguous (Powerful others attributed control beliefs) links to adherence, except for Doctor Health Locus of Control which had a positive association with medication adherence. To fully capture how health locus of control dimensions influence medication adherence, the interaction between the sub-dimensions and the attitudinal symmetry between the doctor and patient, regarding the patient's control over the disease management, can provide promising new alternatives. DISCUSSION: The beneficial effect of patients' high internal and concurrent physician-attributed control beliefs suggests that a so-called ""joint empowerment"" approach can be suitable in order to foster medication adherence, enabling us to address the question of control as a versatile component in the doctor-patient relationship."
"Is sport good for older adults? A systematic review of psychosocial outcomes of older adults"" sport participation"	"Although sport is promoted as a vehicle to enhance health and well-being throughout the life course, little is known about the psychosocial benefits and costs associated with sport participation in older adulthood. A mixed studies systematic review of English-language, peer-reviewed, original research articles (from the earliest record until March 2015) was undertaken to identify psychosocial outcomes of sport for adults over age 65 and to determine whether sport provides psychosocial outcomes that are distinct from other forms of physical activity. Results suggest sport involvement later in life was related to ageing, cognitive/perceptual, emotional, social, and motivational outcomes but it remains unclear whether these effects were solely related to participation in sport. Additional work with increased attention to methodological design and participant recruitment is needed to better understand psychosocial outcomes of older adults"" sport participation and to inform potential interventions. Recommendations to enhance the quality of future studies in the area are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
Is supervised exercise training safe in patients with anorexia nervosa? A meta-analysis.	"Background: Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that is often preceded by excessive physical activity. As such, exercise is not often prescribed in the clinical management of individuals with anorexia nervosa. Objective: To examine the effects of supervised exercise training in patients with anorexia nervosa. Data sources: Five databases were searched from their inception to Week 14 of 2011 using the subject headings 'anorexia' and 'exercise' to identify relevant studies. Eligibility criteria: PRISMA guidelines were followed. Studies that investigated the effects of inclusion of supervised exercise training in clinical management with usual management in patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa were included in this review. Case reports were excluded. Data extraction and synthesis: Two reviewers independently extracted data using a standardised assessment form. Quality assessment was rated for the controlled trials and single-group studies using the PEDro scale and Downs and Black scale, respectively. Fixed or random effect approaches were used to determine effect size, depending on the heterogeneity of the studies. Results: Pooled randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised studies showed no significant effect of supervised exercise training on selected anthropometric measurements, while the single-group studies showed significant improvement in weight and body fat. Although Short Form-36 revealed no training effect, distorted feelings about food and exercise were reduced. Cardiovascular fitness also improved with no decrease in weight. Limitations: Heterogeneity of exercise training programmes, small sample size (. n<=. 20) for 67% of the trials, and inability to exclude publication bias. Conclusions: Inclusion of supervised exercise training in the comprehensive management of patients with anorexia nervosa appears to be safe, as no detrimental effect was observed in anthropometry. Strength and cardiovascular fitness were also shown to improve. ¬© 2012 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy."
"Is the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and metabolic abnormalities increased in early schizophrenia? A comparative meta-analysis of first episode, untreated and treated patients"	"We aimed to discover whether metabolic complications of schizophrenia (SZ) are present in first episode (FE) and unmedicated (UM) patients, in comparison with patients established on antipsychotic medication (AP). Method: A systematic search, critical appraisal, and meta- analysis were conducted of studies to December 2011 using Medline, PsycINFO, Embase and experts. Twenty-six studies examined FE SZ patients (n = 2548) and 19 included UM SZ patients (n = 1325). For comparison we identified 78 publications involving 24 892 medicated patients who had chronic SZ already established on AP. Results: In UM, the overall rate of metabolic syndrome (MetS) was 9.8% using any standardized criteria. Diabetes was found in only 2.1% and hyperglycaemia (>100 mg/dl) in 6.4%. In FE, the overall MetS rate was 9.9%, diabetes was found in only 1.2%, and hyperglycaemia in 8.7%. In UM and FE, the rates of overweight were 26.6%, 22%; hypertriglyceridemia 16.9%, 19.6%; low HDL 20.4%, 21.9%; high blood pressure 24.3%, 30.4%; smoking 40.2%, 46.8%, respectively. In both groups all metabolic components and risk factors were significantly less common in early SZ than in those already established on AP. Waist size, blood pressure and smoking were significantly lower in UM compared with FE. Conclusion: There is a significantly lower cardiovascular risk in early SZ than in chronic SZ. Both diabetes and prediabetes appear uncommon in the early stages, especially in UM. However, smoking does appear to be elevated early after diagnosis. Clinicians should focus on preventing initial cardiometabolic risk because subsequent reduction in this risk is more difficult to achieve, either through behavioral or pharmacologic interventions.

Is There a Need for Including Spiritual Care in Interdisciplinary Rehabilitation of Chronic Pain Patients? Investigating an Innovative Strategy.	"Objective: Chronic noncancer pain influences patient's quality of life and their ability to cope. Pain relieving medication and other specific treatments commonly integrated in biopsychosocial rehabilitation demonstrate modest benefits in pain relief and improved functioning of individuals. Spiritual care, covering the fourth dimension provides insight, inspires hope and purpose, and is thought to mediate mental and physical health for patients. This study explores the need for its inclusion in interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation and describes the requirements and test environment for evaluation. Methods: Outcomes of spiritual care and interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation in follow-up studies of randomized controlled trials contained in systematic reviews were summarized. Pubmed, Cochrane, and PsycINFO were searched, citation tracking was applied, articles of follow-up studies therein were located. Literature was searched for insights pertaining to requirements for an assessment of including this fourth dimension. Results: No systematic reviews for spiritual care were identified. Five systematic reviews of biopsychosocial rehabilitation containing 14 studies describing long-term outcomes were retrieved. The importance of coping in maintaining long-term outcomes was empirically illustrated. The required test environment is provided by a structured multidimensional care pathway separating spirituality from well-being and mental health, with measures of treatment outcome installed enabling a comparison with benchmarks. Conclusions: Active coping seems beneficial for maintaining positive long-term outcomes of interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation Spiritual care may be conducive to active coping. Further research is warranted to explore the additive value of this spiritual care in the context of a multidimensional care pathway."
Job demand and control interventions: a stakeholder-centered best-evidence synthesis of systematic reviews on workplace disability	"BACKGROUND: Physical and psychological job demands in combination with the degree of control a worker has over task completion, play an important role in reducing stress. Occupational stress is an important, modifiable factor affecting work disability. However, the effectiveness of reducing job demands or increasing job control remains unclear, particularly for outcomes of interest to employers, such as absenteeism or productivity. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review reports on job demand and control interventions that impact absenteeism, productivity and financial outcomes. METHODS: A stakeholder-centered best-evidence synthesis was conducted with researcher and stakeholder collaboration throughout. Databases and grey literature were searched for systematic reviews between 2000 and 2012: Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, TRIP, health-evidence.ca, Rehab+, National Rehabilitation Information Center (NARIC), and Institute for Work and Health. Articles were assessed independently by two researchers for inclusion criteria and methodological quality. Differences were resolved through consensus. RESULTS: The search resulted in 3363 unique titles. After review of abstracts, 115 articles were retained for full-text review. 11 articles finally met the inclusion criteria and are summarized in this synthesis. The best level of evidence we found indicates that multimodal job demand reductions for either at-work or off-work workers will reduce disability-related absenteeism. CONCLUSION: In general, the impacts of interventions that aim to reduce job demands or increase job control can be positive for the organization in terms of reducing absenteeism, increasing productivity and cost-effectiveness. However, more high quality research is needed to further assess the relationships and quantify effect sizes for the interventions and outcomes reviewed in this study."
Just telling and selling: current limitations in the use of digital media in public health: a scoping review	"OBJECTIVE: To undertake a scoping review and to map research in the area of digital media use in public health. STUDY DESIGN: Scoping review. METHODS: PubMed, PsycINFO, Google and major textbooks of public health communication and health psychology were searched for primary studies or systematic reviews examining the use of digital media in a health context. Searches focussed on studies published between the start of 2000 and the end of June 2013. Abstracts of reviews of public health interventions were examined with respect to target groups, health topic, intervention characteristics, media used, study design, issues of quality and ethics, and outcomes. To map this area of work fully, this information was supplemented by adding information from primary studies. Areas were identified where systematic review evidence was scarce or non-existent by comparing the final map with information from the reviews analysed. RESULTS: 221 systematic reviews related to digital media use in a public health context were included. Most reviews included studies with an experimental design and general 'at risk' target populations. Specific settings were not specified in the majority of reviews. A large variety of health topics were covered. About a quarter of reviews did not specify a health topic but were concerned with broader issues of health promotion, disease prevention, or health education. Over half of the reviews focussed on eHealth and telemedicine, and another third were concerned with mass media - social marketing. Reviews most frequently reported behaviour-related outcomes or conducted some form of content analysis or analysis of the use of particular media. Research gaps were identified relating to community-based research, participation and empowerment, active media use (especially with respect to visual media und use of specific visual methodologies), and the use of salutogenic or assets-based approaches. CONCLUSION: The available research relating to digital media use in public health is dominated by studies relating to eHealth, telehealth or social marketing; emphasising the passive reception of messages and a focus on individual behaviour change approaches. Issues of quality and ethics need to be taken into account more consistently. Further research is needed with respect to more participatory methods, particularly those which would seek to use digital media as a means to harness individual and community assets.

Keeping it in the family? People with learning disabilities and families employing their own care and support workers: findings from a scoping review of the literature.	"This article focuses on people with learning disabilities and their families who employ care or support workers using public (government) and/or private (self and family) funds. Such consumer-directed support takes place in England through personal budgets and direct payments. Research and material relevant to these employment relationships were explored in a scoping review undertaken by the authors in 2010. The review identified a small number of studies that involved people with learning disabilities as respondents, although more relied on family carers as proxy respondents. The findings from these studies covered recruitment and administration, employment of family members, training needs, the nature and content of employment relationships, and ending employment. The review observed that employment relationships, practices, and dynamics are surprisingly little explored in the literature and generally unobserved. The article concludes with specific messages from the review for family carers, for people with learning disabilities and for care and support workers."
Key characteristics of knowledge transfer and exchange in healthcare: integrative literature review	"Aim. This paper presents the results of a review of literature relating to knowledge transfer and exchange in healthcare. Background. Treatment, planning and policy decisions in contemporary nursing and healthcare should be based on sound evidence wherever possible, but research knowledge remains generally underused. Knowledge transfer and exchange initiatives aim to facilitate the accessibility, application and production of evidence and may provide solutions to this challenge. This review was conducted to help inform the design and implementation of knowledge transfer and exchange activities for a large healthcare organization. Data sources. Databases: ASSIA, Business Source Premier, CINAHL, PsychInfo, Medline and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Review methods. An integrative literature review was carried out including an extensive literature search. English language systematic reviews, literature reviews, primary quantitative and qualitative papers and grey literature of high relevance evaluating, describing or discussing knowledge transfer or exchange activities in healthcare were included for review (January 1990-September 2009). Findings. Thirty-three papers were reviewed (four systematic reviews, nine literature reviews, one environmental scan, nine empirical studies and ten case studies). Conclusion. Robust research into knowledge transfer and exchange in healthcare is limited. Analysis of a wide range of evidence indicates a number of commonly featured characteristics but further evaluation of these activities would benefit their application in facilitating evidence-based practice in nursing."
Key components of knowledge transfer and exchange in health services research: Findings from a systematic scoping review.	"AIMS: To identify the key common components of knowledge transfer and exchange in existing models to facilitate practice developments in health services research. BACKGROUND: There are over 60 models of knowledge transfer and exchange designed for various areas of health care. Many of them remain untested and lack guidelines for scaling-up of successful implementation of research findings and of proven models ensuring that patients have access to optimal health care, guided by current research. DESIGN: A scoping review was conducted in line with PRISMA guidelines. Key components of knowledge transfer and exchange were identified using thematic analysis and frequency counts. DATA SOURCES: Six electronic databases were searched for papers published before January 2015 containing four key terms/variants: knowledge, transfer, framework, health care. REVIEW METHODS: Double screening, extraction and coding of the data using thematic analysis were employed to ensure rigour. As further validation stakeholders' consultation of the findings was performed to ensure accessibility. RESULTS: Of the 4,288 abstracts, 294 full-text articles were screened, with 79 articles analysed. Six key components emerged: knowledge transfer and exchange message, Stakeholders and Process components often appeared together, while from two contextual components Inner Context and the wider Social, Cultural and Economic Context, with the wider context less frequently considered. Finally, there was little consideration of the Evaluation of knowledge transfer and exchange activities. In addition, specific operational elements of each component were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The six components offer the basis for knowledge transfer and exchange activities, enabling researchers to more effectively share their work. Further research exploring the potential contribution of the interactions of the components is recommended. Copyright ¬© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Key stakeholder perceptions about consent to participate in acute illness research: a rapid, systematic review to inform epi/pandemic research preparedness"	"BACKGROUND: A rigorous research response is required to inform clinical and public health decision-making during an epi/pandemic. However, the ethical conduct of such research, which often involves critically ill patients, may be complicated by the diminished capacity to consent and an imperative to initiate trial therapies within short time frames. Alternative approaches to taking prospective informed consent may therefore be used. We aimed to rapidly review evidence on key stakeholder (patients, their proxy decision-makers, clinicians and regulators) views concerning the acceptability of various approaches for obtaining consent relevant to pandemic-related acute illness research. METHODS: We conducted a rapid evidence review, using the Internet, database and hand-searching for English language empirical publications from 1996 to 2014 on stakeholder opinions of consent models (prospective informed, third-party, deferred, or waived) used in acute illness research. We excluded research on consent to treatment, screening, or other such procedures, non-emergency research and secondary studies. Papers were categorised, and data summarised using narrative synthesis. RESULTS: We screened 689 citations, reviewed 104 full-text articles and included 52. Just one paper related specifically to pandemic research. In other emergency research contexts potential research participants, clinicians and research staff found third-party, deferred, and waived consent to be acceptable as a means to feasibly conduct such research. Acceptability to potential participants was motivated by altruism, trust in the medical community, and perceived value in medical research and decreased as the perceived risks associated with participation increased. Discrepancies were observed in the acceptability of the concept and application or experience of alternative consent models. Patients accepted clinicians acting as proxy-decision makers, with preference for two decision makers as invasiveness of interventions increased. Research regulators were more cautious when approving studies conducted with alternative consent models; however, their views were generally under-represented. CONCLUSIONS: Third-party, deferred, and waived consent models are broadly acceptable to potential participants, clinicians and/or researchers for emergency research. Further consultation with key stakeholders, particularly with regulators, and studies focused specifically on epi/pandemic research, are required. We highlight gaps and recommendations to inform set-up and protocol development for pandemic research and institutional review board processes. PROSPERO PROTOCOL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42014014000."
Kinesio taping improves pain and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials	"OBJECTIVE: To perform a meta-analysis from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy of Kinesio Taping in reducing pain and increasing knee function in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: The electronic databases include PubMed, Embase, web of science and the Cochrane Library up to August 2018. Studies searched were considered eligible if they met the criteria as follows: Population: patients with knee OA; Intervention: intervention groups received Kinesio Taping for the treatment of knee OA; Comparisons: Control group received sham taping; 3) Outcomes: visual analog scale (VAS), McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scale, range of motion and muscle strength; Study design: RCTs. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was used to assess risk of bias. We assessed statistical heterogeneity for each RCT with the use of a standard Chi2 test and the I2 statistic. STATA statistical software 15.0 was used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Five RCTs involving 308 patients were included. The present meta-analysis demonstrated that there were significant differences between Kinesio Taping groups and control groups in terms of visual analog scale (VAS), WOMAC scale and flexion range of motion. No significant difference was found regarding quadriceps femoris muscle between groups. CONCLUSION: Kinesio Taping is effective in improving for pain and joint function in patients with knee OA. Due to the limited quality of the evidence currently available, the results of our meta-analysis should be treated with caution. Copyright ¬© 2018 IJS Publishing Group Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Knowledge is not power for patients: a systematic review and thematic synthesis of patient-reported barriers and facilitators to shared decision making	"OBJECTIVE: To systematically review patient-reported barriers and facilitators to shared decision making (SDM) and develop a taxonomy of patient-reported barriers. METHODS: Systematic review and thematic synthesis. Study findings/results for each included paper were extracted verbatim and entered into qualitative software for inductive analysis. RESULTS: Electronic and follow-up searches yielded 2956 unique references; 289 full-text articles were retrieved, of which 45 articles from 44 unique studies met inclusion criteria. Key descriptive themes were grouped under two broad analytical themes: how the healthcare system is organized (4 descriptive themes) and what happens during the decision-making interaction (4 descriptive themes, 10 sub-themes). Predominant emergent themes related to patients' knowledge and the power imbalance in the doctor-patient relationship. Patients need knowledge and power to participate in SDM - knowledge alone is insufficient and power is more difficult to attain. CONCLUSION: Many barriers are potentially modifiable, and can be addressed by attitudinal changes at the levels of patient, clinician/healthcare team, and the organization. The results support the view that many patients currently can't participate in SDM, rather than they won't participate because they do not want to. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Future implementation efforts should address patient-reported factors together with known clinician-reported barriers and the wider organizational context.

Knowledge translation strategies to improve the use of evidence in public health decision making in local government: intervention design and implementation plan	"Background: Knowledge translation strategies are an approach to increase the use of evidence within policy and practice decision-making contexts. In clinical and health service contexts, knowledge translation strategies have focused on individual behavior change, however the multi-system context of public health requires a multi-level, multi-strategy approach. This paper describes the design of and implementation plan for a knowledge translation intervention for public health decision making in local government.Methods: Four preliminary research studies contributed findings to the design of the intervention: a systematic review of knowledge translation intervention effectiveness research, a scoping study of knowledge translation perspectives and relevant theory literature, a survey of the local government public health workforce, and a study of the use of evidence-informed decision-making for public health in local government. A logic model was then developed to represent the putative pathways between intervention inputs, processes, and outcomes operating between individual-, organizational-, and system-level strategies. This formed the basis of the intervention plan.Results: The systematic and scoping reviews identified that effective and promising strategies to increase access to research evidence require an integrated intervention of skill development, access to a knowledge broker, resources and tools for evidence-informed decision making, and networking for information sharing. Interviews and survey analysis suggested that the intervention needs to operate at individual and organizational levels, comprising workforce development, access to evidence, and regular contact with a knowledge broker to increase access to intervention evidence; develop skills in appraisal and integration of evidence; strengthen networks; and explore organizational factors to build organizational cultures receptive to embedding evidence in practice. The logic model incorporated these inputs and strategies with a set of outcomes to measure the intervention's effectiveness based on the theoretical frameworks, evaluation studies, and decision-maker experiences.Conclusion: Documenting the design of and implementation plan for this knowledge translation intervention provides a transparent, theoretical, and practical approach to a complex intervention. It provides significant insights into how practitioners might engage with evidence in public health decision making. While this intervention model was designed for the local government context, it is likely to be applicable and generalizable across sectors and settings.Trial Registration: Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Register ACTRN12609000953235."
"Knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours towards cancer screening in indigenous populations: A systematic review."	"Cancer mortality among indigenous peoples is increasing, but these populations commonly under use cancer-screening services. This systematic review explores knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours towards cancer screening among indigenous peoples worldwide. Searches of major bibliographic databases identified primary studies published in English up to March, 2014; of 33 eligible studies, three were cohort studies, 27 cross-sectional, and three case-control. Knowledge of and participation in screening was greater for breast cancer than for other cancers. Indigenous peoples tended to have less knowledge, less favourable attitudes, and a higher propensity to refuse screening than non-indigenous populations. The most common factors affecting knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours towards cancer screening included access to screening, knowledge about cancer and screening, educational attainment, perceived necessity of screening, and age. Greater understanding of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours towards cancer screening in diverse indigenous cultures is needed so that culturally appropriate cancer prevention programmes can be provided."
Lack of efficacy of Tai Chi in improving quality of life in breast cancer survivors: a systematic review and meta-analysis	"BACKGROUND: It is controversial whether Tai Chi (TC) benefits breast cancer survivors (BCS) on quality of life (QoL). We therefore undertook a meta-analysis to assess this question. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A computerized search through electronic databases was performed to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The primary outcome was QoL, while secondary outcomes included body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density (BMD), and muscle strength. RESULTS: Five RCTs involving 407 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled standardized mean differences were 0.10 (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.35-0.54) for physical well- being, 0.03 (95%CI: -0.18-0.25) for social/family well-being, 0.24 (95%CI: 0.02-0.45) for emotional well-being, 0.23 (95%CI: -0.03-0.49) for functional well-being, and 0.09 (95%CI: -0.19-0.36) for additional concerns. TC failed to improve BMI, BMD, and muscle strength. CONCLUSIONS: There is currently lack of sufficient evidence to support TC improving QoL and other important clinical endpoints."
Learning from the emergence of NIHR Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRCs): a systematic review of evaluations	"BACKGROUND: Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRCs) were funded by NIHR in England in 2008 and 2014 as partnerships between universities and surrounding health service organisations, focused on improving the quality of healthcare through the conduct and application of applied health research. The aim of this review is to synthesise learning from evaluations of the CLAHRCs. METHODS: Fifteen databases including CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched to identify any evaluations of CLAHRCs. Current and archived CLAHRC websites and the reference lists of retrieved articles were scanned to identify any additional evaluations. Searches were restricted to English language only. Any publications from evaluations of the CLAHRCs were eligible for inclusion if they fulfilled at least one of three pre-specified inclusion criteria. A narrative synthesis was undertaken. RESULTS: Twenty-six evaluations (reported in 37 papers) were deemed eligible for inclusion. Evaluations focused on describing and exploring the formative partnerships, vision, values, structures and processes of CLAHRCs; the nature and role of boundaries; the deployment of knowledge brokers and hybrid roles to support knowledge mobilisation; patient and public involvement; and capacity building. The relative lack of data about the early impact of CLAHRCs on health care provision or outcomes is notable. CONCLUSIONS: Much of the evaluative focus on CLAHRCs has been on how they have been organised and on the development of theory around their emergent properties. Evidence is lacking on the impact of CLAHRCs particularly in relation to the knowledge mobilisation processes and practices adopted. Further evaluation of CLAHRCs and other similar research and practice partnerships is warranted and should focus on which knowledge mobilisation approaches work where, how and why.

Lifestyle Interventions in Preschool Children: A Meta-analysis of Effectiveness	"CONTEXT: With healthy behaviors becoming established in the preschool years, intervening with preschool children to assist them in establishing a healthy lifestyle and maintaining a long-term healthy weight is critical. To optimize future intervention designs, this meta-analysis aimed to estimate the effects of lifestyle interventions on BMI among preschool children and explore potential intervention moderators. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: In October 2015, a search of PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ERIC, and Cochrane library databases yielded 52 eligible articles with 42 randomized intervention-control comparisons (31 prevention and 11 treatment). In 2016, weighted standardized mean differences for BMI were calculated using random-effects models to estimate effect sizes. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The effect sizes were -0.19 (95% CI=-0.28, -0.09) and -0.28 (95% CI=-0.48, -0.09) kg/m2 for prevention and treatment interventions, with sustained effect sizes of -0.21 (95% CI=-0.35, -0.08) and -0.23 (95% CI=-0.43, -0.04) kg/m2, respectively. Child mean age, percentage Hispanic, and parental intervention sessions were common significant moderators. School-based or prevention interventions with active parental involvement did not yield better outcomes. Interventions targeting parents with parenting skill training and behavioral change strategies, and children with general health and nutrition education, resulted in greater effects. CONCLUSIONS: Although publication bias limits the validity of the study findings, the meta-analysis results highlight the promising intervention approaches of parenting skill training and behavioral change strategies to target parents. However, for children, general health and nutrition education should be employed. Copyright ¬© 2017 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Lifestyle interventions targeting dietary habits and exercise in bipolar disorder: A systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a serious mental illness associated with a high risk of medical comorbidities, long-term disability and premature death. This systematic review examined the current literature on therapeutic interventions targeting nutrition, physical activity and wellness in BD and collecting health-related measures such as mood and course of illness. METHODS: Scopus (all databases), Pubmed and Ovid Medline were systematically searched with no language or year restrictions, up to June 2015, for studies focusing on lifestyle interventions in BD. Search terms were related to bipolar disorder, nutrition, physical activity, wellbeing, psychosocial interventions and course of illness. We hand searched content pages of Bipolar Disorders and Journal of Affective Disorders and checked references of relevant reviews and dissertations to identify additional papers. RESULTS: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria to identified hits, this literature search retrieved six papers. Overall findings point towards a beneficial role of lifestyle interventions on mood, weight, blood pressure, lipid profile, physical activity and overall wellbeing. Methodological limitations include small sample size, gender ratio imbalance, inconsistencies in terms of laboratory measures, and lack of randomized controlled trials and absence of follow-up and longitudinal studies to determine the benefits of these factors on clinical and functional outcomes over time CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle interventions in BD targeting nutrition, exercise, wellbeing alongside beliefs, coping strategies and attitudes towards health show promise in reducing the risk of comorbid ailments in BD. There is still a strong need for studies a) developing interventions which are informed by the patient's input and b) examining the effectiveness of such interventions targeting general wellness using well-controlled trials.

Listening to the voice of patients with head and neck cancer: A systematic review and meta-synthesis	"The aim was to conduct a systematic review and a meta-synthesis of primary qualitative studies exploring experiences of head and neck cancer patients (HNC) undergoing radio and/or chemotherapy, in order to provide a better understanding of this phenomenon and supply new directions for care and clinical practice. Six databases were systematically searched, and 13 studies were included. The meta-synthesis methodology was adopted to conceptualise the way in which patients lived their cancer journey and the impact of treatments on their daily life. Four themes embracing various aspects of HNC patients' experiences were identified: (a) self-body image and perceived quality of life; (b) experiences and treatment of symptoms; (c) cancer journey; and (d) the relationship with health professionals. The finding demonstrates the importance of acknowledging that treatment sequelae and patients' daily issues do not appear, develop and affect people's lives in isolation and should be considered and analysed as a whole within the social and cultural context of patients' lives. Further research is needed to explore the treatment experience of HNC patients throughout their cancer journey with a more holistic approach that involves health professionals, caregivers and other family members and peers in the community.

"Living with, managing and minimising treatment burden in long term conditions: a systematic review of qualitative research"	"BACKGROUND: 'Treatment burden', defined as both the workload and impact of treatment regimens on function and well-being, has been associated with poor adherence and unfavourable outcomes. Previous research focused on treatment workload but our understanding of treatment impact is limited. This research aimed to systematically review qualitative research to identify: 1) what are the treatment generated disruptions experienced by patients across all chronic conditions and treatments? 2) what strategies do patients employ to minimise these treatment generated disruptions? METHODS AND FINDINGS: The search strategy centred on: treatment burden and qualitative methods. Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and PsychINFO were searched electronically from inception to Dec 2013. No language limitations were set. Teams of two reviewers independently conducted paper screening, data extraction, and data analysis. Data were analysed using framework synthesis informed by Cumulative Complexity Model. Eleven papers reporting data from 294 patients, across a range of conditions, age groups and nationalities were included. Treatment burdens were experienced as a series of disruptions: biographical disruptions involved loss of freedom and independence, restriction of meaningful activities, negative emotions and stigma; relational disruptions included strained family and social relationships and feeling isolated; and, biological disruptions involved physical side-effects. Patients employed ""adaptive treatment work"" and ""rationalised non-adherence"" to minimise treatment disruptions. Rationalised non-adherence was sanctioned by health professionals at end of life; at other times it was a ""secret-act"" which generated feelings of guilt and impacted on family and clinical relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Treatments generate negative emotions and physical side effects, strain relationships and affect identity. Patients minimise these disruptions through additional adaptive work and/or by non-adherence. This affects physical outcomes and care relationships. There is a need for clinicians to engage with patients in honest conversations about treatment disruptions and the 'adhere-ability' of recommended regimens. Patient-centred practice requires management plans which optimise outcomes and minimise disruptions."
Long-Term Condition Self-Management Support in Online Communities: A Meta-Synthesis of Qualitative Papers	"BACKGROUND: Recent years have seen an exponential increase in people with long-term conditions using the Internet for information and support. Prior research has examined support for long-term condition self-management through the provision of illness, everyday, and emotional work in the context of traditional offline communities. However, less is known about how communities hosted in digital spaces contribute through the creation of social ties and the mobilization of an online illness ""workforce."" OBJECTIVE: The aim was to understand the negotiation of long-term condition illness work in patient online communities and how such work may assist the self-management of long-term conditions in daily life. METHODS: A systematic search of qualitative papers was undertaken using various online databases for articles published since 2004. A total of 21 papers met the inclusion criteria of using qualitative methods and examined the use of peer-led online communities for those with a long-term condition. A qualitative meta-synthesis was undertaken and the review followed a line of argument synthesis. RESULTS: The main themes identified in relation to the negotiation of self-management support were (1) redressing offline experiential information and knowledge deficits, (2) the influence of modeling and learning behaviors from others on self-management, (3) engagement that validates illness and negates offline frustrations, (4) tie formation and community building, (5) narrative expression and cathartic release, and (6) dissociative anonymity and invisibility. These translated into a line of argument synthesis in which four network mechanisms for self-management support in patient online communities were identified. These were (1) collective knowledge and identification through lived experience; (2) support, information, and engagement through readily accessible gifting relationships; (3) sociability that extends beyond illness; and (4) online disinhibition as a facilitator in the negotiation of self-management support. CONCLUSIONS: Social ties forged in online spaces provide the basis for performing relevant self-management work that can improve an individual's illness experience, tackling aspects of self-management that are particularly difficult to meet offline. Membership in online groups can provide those living with a long-term condition with ready access to a self-management support illness workforce and illness and emotional support. The substitutability of offline illness work may be particularly important to those whose access to support offline is either limited or absent. Furthermore, such resources require little negotiation online because information and support is seemingly gifted to the community by its members."
Long-term outcomes of ADHD: A systematic review of self-esteem and social function	"Objective: To compare the long-term self-esteem and social function outcomes of individuals with untreated and treated ADHD across childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Method: A systematic search of 12 databases was performed to identify peer-reviewed, primary research articles, published January 1980 to December 2011, reporting long-term self-esteem and/or social function outcomes (â2 years; life consequences distinct from symptoms) of individuals with untreated or treated ADHD. Results: Overall, 127 studies reported 150 outcomes. Most outcomes were poorer in individuals with untreated ADHD versus non-ADHD controls (57% 13/23] for self-esteem; 73% 52/71] for social function). A beneficial response to treatment (pharmacological, nonpharmacological, and multimodal treatments) was reported for the majority of self-esteem (89% 8/9]) and social function (77% 17/22]) outcomes. Conclusion: Untreated ADHD was associated with poorer long-term self-esteem and social function outcomes compared with non-ADHD controls. Treatment for ADHD was associated with improvement in outcomes; however, further long-term outcome studies are needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
Managed alcohol as a harm reduction intervention for alcohol addiction in populations at high risk for substance abuse	"BACKGROUND: Managed alcohol programmes (MAP) are a harm reduction strategy used to minimise the personal harm and adverse societal effects that alcohol dependence can lead to by providing an alternative to zero-tolerance approaches that incorporate drinking goals (abstinence or moderation) that are compatible with the needs of the individual, and promoting access to services by offering low-threshold alternatives. This enables clients to gain access to services despite continued alcohol consumption and works to help the patient understand the risks involved in their behaviour and make decisions about their own treatment goals. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of MAP treatment regimens (serving limited quantities of alcohol daily to alcoholics) on their own or as compared to moderate drinking (self-controlled drinking), screening and brief intervention using a harm reduction approach, traditional abstinence-based interventions (12 step programmes) and no intervention. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO up to March 2012. This search was expanded by handsearching of high-yield journals and conference proceedings that had not already been handsearched on behalf of The Cochrane Collaboration, searching reference lists of all papers and relevant reviews identified, references to ongoing and recently completed clinical trials in the National Research Register and IFPMA Clinical Trials Database (which contains ClinicalTrials.gov, Centerwatch, Current Controlled Trials and ClinicalStudyResults.gov, and Osservatorio Nazionale sulla Sperimentazione Clinica dei Medicinali). Trials registers, grey literature and reference lists were also searched. Individuals, organisations and experts in the field were contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised control trials (RCT), controlled clinical trials (CCT), interrupted time series (ITS) studies, and control before and after (CBA) studies involving vulnerable people aged 18 years or older who were at high risk for alcohol abuse attending MAP, defined as a structured programme that provided clients with controlled amounts of alcohol on a daily schedule, comparing no treatment, moderate drinking, brief intervention or 12-step variants. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: All study citations were collated into a single database. Two review author independently screened titles and abstracts and selected references potentially relevant to the review. Differences between selection lists were resolved by discussion. Two review authors independently evaluated whether studies should be included or excluded according to the eligibility criteria. In the event of a disagreement, a third author was consulted. MAIN RESULTS: No studies were included in the review. This systematic review was intended to assess the effectiveness of a brief MAP on the reduction of incidence of harmful behaviour; however, no evidence was available to make this comparison; 22 articles were considered possibly relevant and all were excluded. Most articles were excluded because they failed to compare or consider managed alcohol as the experimental or control intervention, as well as one study (Baker 2010), which was also excluded because study participants were under 18 years of age. No study reviewed offered an intervention that was compared with managed alcohol or considered it as the intervention of interest, providing insufficient evidence to address the objectives of the review. Four studies (Aalto 2001; Baker 2010; Bertholet 2005; Tracy 2007) considered alcohol reduction as an outcome of interest, while four engaged interventions in a shelter setting or targeted vulnerable people (Baker 2010; Bradford 2005; Lapham 1993; McGlynn 1993); only one study (Kidd 2011) offered a qualitative assessment of a participant being admitted to MAP, but offered no analysis of the programme itself. These results accurately reflect the use of MAPs in current practice as existing programmes are ongoing only in a small number of sample pilot projects that target individuals with severe alcohol dependence or who consume non-beverage alcohol. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The lack of evidence does not allow for a conclusion regarding the efficacy of MAP on their own, or as compared to brief intervention, moderate drinking, no intervention or 12-step variants. It is the review authors' opinion that it is likely to be the objective of MAPs that reduce their reportability and use in current practice, rather than a failure to provide an intervention that reduces the effects of alcohol dependence. Aiming to reduce harmful or antisocial behaviour in vulnerable individuals through the regulation of daily alcohol intake, rather than reducing harmful alcohol intake over time, provides considerable difficulty in developing measures of success from self-reported data (low treatment thresholds), monitoring long-term efficacy or establishing causal links between programme admission and a reduction in targeted behaviours, owing to the fact that prolonged participation in the programme is likely to indicate a willingness in the individual to change their behaviour patterns. More effort is needed to develop reporting measures, as well as methodologies, which address these specific challenges."
Mapping the evolving definitions of translational research.	"Objective Systematic review and analysis of definitions of translational research. Materials and methods The final corpus was comprised of 33 papers, each read by at least 2 reviewers. Definitions were mapped to a common set of research processes for presentation and analysis. Influence of papers and definitions was further evaluated using citation analysis and agglomerative clustering. Results All definitions were mapped to common research processes, revealing most common labels for each process. Agglomerative clustering revealed 3 broad families of definitions. Citation analysis showed that the originating paper of each family has been cited ~10 times more than any other member. Discussion Although there is little agreement between definitions, we were able to identify an emerging consensus 5-phase (T0-T4) definition for translational research. T1 involves processes that bring ideas from basic research through early testing in humans. T2 involves the establishment of effectiveness in humans and clinical guidelines. T3 primarily focuses on implementation and dissemination research while T4 focuses on outcomes and effectiveness in populations. T0 involves research such as genome-wide association studies which wrap back around to basic research. Conclusion We used systematic review and analysis to identify emerging consensus between definitions of translational research phases."
Marital adjustment in the context of female breast cancer: A systematic review	"OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer (BC) diagnosis and subsequent treatments present significant challenges and distress for both patients and their partners. This can lead to difficulties in marital relationships and, consequently, decreases in marital adjustment and psychosocial adaptation to BC for both partners. Our objective was to systematically review studies assessing marital adjustment in the context of female BC to understand which factors are associated with marital adjustment in both patients and partners and characterize the measures used to assess marital adjustment within these studies. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. English, peer-reviewed articles exploring factors associated with marital adjustment in the context of female BC were considered for inclusion. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included. Results evidenced that psychosocial variables play an important role on marital adjustment. Specifically, open and constructive communication, more social support, and supportive dyadic coping were found to be associated with higher levels of marital adjustment. Other variables such as self-efficacy, sexual functioning, and psychological adjustment were also positively associated with marital adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies evidenced an association between psychosocial variables and marital adjustment for both women and their partners. Some important dimensions such as communication patterns, coping strategies, and social support dynamics were identified as potential targets for psychological interventions. Some variables, however, were explored only in a few studies, which limit our conclusions. Future studies should explore the role these variables and other relational and emotional variables play in promoting marital adjustment after BC. Copyright ¬© 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
Mass media interventions for preventing smoking in young people.	"Background Mass media interventions can be used as a way of delivering preventive health messages. They have the potential to reach and modify the knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of a large proportion of the community. Objectives To assess the effects of mass media interventions on preventing smoking in young people, and whether it can reduce smoking uptake among youth (under 25 years), improve smoking attitudes, intentions and knowledge, improve self-efficacy/self-esteem, and improve perceptions about smoking, including the choice to follow positive role models. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register, with additional searches of MEDLINE and Embase in June 2016. This is an update of a review first published in 1998. Selection criteria Randomized trials, controlled trials without randomization and interrupted time-series studies that assessed the effect of mass media campaigns (defined as channels of communication such as television, radio, newspapers, social media, billboards, posters, leaflets or booklets intended to reach large numbers of people and which are not dependent on person-to-person contact) in influencing the smoking behaviour (either objective or self-reported) of young people under the age of 25 years. We define smoking behaviour as the presence or absence of tobacco smoking or other tobacco use, or both, and the frequency of tobacco use. Eligible comparators included education or no intervention. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted information relating to the characteristics and the content of media interventions, participants, outcomes, methods of the study and risks of bias. We combined studies using qualitative narrative synthesis. We assessed the risks of bias for each study using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, alongside additional domains to account for the nature of the intervention. We assessed the quality of evidence contributing to outcomes using GRADE. Main results We identified eight eligible studies reporting information about mass media smoking campaigns, one of which is new for this update. Seven of the studies used a controlled trial design and one an interrupted time-series analysis. Risks of bias were high across all included studies and there was considerable heterogeneity in study design, intervention and population being assessed.Three studies (n = 17,385), one of which compared a mass media intervention to no intervention and two of which evaluated mass media interventions as adjuncts to school-based interventions, found that the mass media interventions reduced the smoking behaviour of young people. The remaining five studies (n = 72,740) did not detect a significant effect on smoking behaviour. These included three studies comparing a mass media intervention to no intervention, one study evaluating a mass media intervention as an adjunct to a school-based intervention, and one interrupted time-series study of a social media intervention. The three campaigns which found a significant effect described their theoretical basis, used formative research in designing the campaign messages, and used message broadcast of reasonable intensity over extensive periods of time. However, some of the campaigns which did not detect an effect also exhibited these characteristics. Effective campaigns tended to last longer (minimum 3 years) and were more intense (more contact time) for both school-based lessons (minimum eight lessons per grade) and media spots (minimum four weeks' duration across multiple media channels with between 167 and 350 TV and radio spots). Implementation of combined school-based components (e.g. school posters) and the use of repetitive media messages delivered by multiple channels (e.g. newspapers, radio, television) appeared to contribute to successful campaigns. Authors' conclusions Certainty about the effects of mass media campaigns on smoking behaviour in youth is very low, due to inconsistency between studies in both design and results, and due to methodological issues amongst the included studies. It would therefore be unwise to offer firm conclusions based on the evidence in this review. Methodologically rigorous studies investigating the effect of social media and novel forms of technology as part of tobacco prevention campaigns for youth are needed."
Mass media interventions for reducing mental health-related stigma.	"Background Mental health-related stigma is widespread and has major adverse effects on the lives of people with mental health problems. Its two major components are discrimination (being treated unfairly) and prejudice (stigmatising attitudes). Anti-stigma initiatives often include mass media interventions, and such interventions can be expensive. It is important to know if mass media interventions are effective. Objectives To assess the effects of mass media interventions on reducing stigma (discrimination and prejudice) related to mental ill health compared to inactive controls, and to make comparisons of effectiveness based on the nature of the intervention (e.g. number of mass media components), the content of the intervention (e.g. type of primary message), and the type of media (e.g. print, internet). Search methods We searched eleven databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 7, 2011); MEDLINE (OvidSP),1966 to 15 August 2011; EMBASE (OvidSP),1947 to 15 August 2011; PsycINFO (OvidSP), 1806 to 15 August 2011; CINAHL (EBSCOhost) 1981 to 16 August 2011; ERIC (CSA), 1966 to 16 August 2011; Social Science Citation Index (ISI), 1956 to 16 August 2011; OpenSIGLE (http:///), 1980 to 18 August 2012; Worldcat Dissertations and Theses (OCLC), 1978 to 18 August 2011; metaRegister of Controlled Trials (http://-trials.com/mrct/mrct_about.asp), 1973 to 18 August 2011; and Ichushi (OCLC), 1903 to 11 November 2011. We checked references from articles and reviews, and citations from included studies. We also searched conference abstracts and websites, and contacted researchers. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs or interrupted time series studies of mass media interventions compared to inactive controls in members of the general public or any of its constituent groups (excluding studies in which all participants were people with mental health problems), with mental health as a subject of the intervention and discrimination or prejudice outcome measures. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We contacted study authors for missing information. Information about adverse effects was collected from study reports. Primary outcomes were discrimination and prejudice, and secondary outcomes were knowledge, cost, reach, recall, and awareness of interventions, duration/sustainability of media effects, audience reactions to media content, and unforeseen adverse effects. We calculated standardised mean differences and odds ratios. We conducted a primarily narrative synthesis due to the heterogeneity of included studies. Subgroup analyses were undertaken to examine the effects of the nature, content and type of mass media intervention. Main results We included 22 studies involving 4490 participants. All were randomised trials (3 were cluster RCTs), and 19 of the 22 studies had analysable outcome data. Seventeen of the studies had student populations. Most of the studies were at unclear or high risk of bias for all forms of bias except detection bias. Authors' conclusions Mass media interventions may reduce prejudice, but there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects on discrimination. Very little is known about costs, adverse effects or other outcomes. Our review found few studies in middle- and low-income countries, or with employers or health professionals as the target group, and none targeted at children or adolescents. The findings are limited by the quality of the evidence, which was low for the primary outcomes for discrimination and prejudice, low for adverse effects and very low for costs. More research is required to establish the effects of mass media interventions on discrimination, to better understand which types of mass media intervention work best, to provide evidence about cost-effectiveness, and to fill evidence gaps about types of mass media not covered in this review. Such research should use robust methods, report data more consistently with reporting guidelines and be less reliant on student populations."
Measurement issues of shared decision making in mental health: challenges and opportunities	"Purpose Shared decision making (SDM) is a model of health care in which patients are involved in the decision-making process about their treatment, considering their preferences and concerns in a deliberative process with the health care provider. Many existing instruments assess the antecedents, process, or the outcomes of SDM. The purpose of this paper is to identify the SDM-related measures applied in a mental health context. Design/methodology/approach The authors performed a systematic review in several electronic databases from 1990 to October 2016. Studies that assessed quantitatively one or more constructs related to SDM (antecedents, process, and outcomes) in the field of mental health were included. Findings The authors included 87 studies that applied 48 measures on distinct SDM constructs. A large majority of them have been developed in the field of physical diseases and adapted or directly applied in the mental health context. The most evaluated construct is the SDM process in consultation, mainly by patients' self-report but also by external observer measures, followed by the patients' preferences for involvement in decision making. The most applied instrument was the Autonomy Preference Index, followed by the Observing Patient Involvement in Decision Making (OPTION) and the Control Preferences Scale (CPS). The psychometric validation in mental health samples of the instruments identified is scarce. Research limitations/implications The bibliographic search is comprehensive, but could not be completely exhaustive. Effort should be invested in the development of new SDM for mental health tools that will reflect the complexity and specific features of mental health care. Originality/value The authors highlight several limitations and challenges for the measurement of SDM in mental health care."
Measurement of substance-free reinforcement in addiction: A systematic review.	"A robust body of theoretical and experimental work highlights the influence of alternative, substance-free rewards on decisions to use alcohol and other drugs. However, translational applications have been limited in part by the lack of consensus on how to measure substance-free reinforcement in applied and clinical settings. The current study summarizes extant research utilizing self-report reinforcement or reward methodologies, and critically reviews the psychometric properties of the available measures. These studies (N = 50) fell into three categories: measures of recent substance-related and substance-free activity participation and enjoyment (n = 32), measures of time or monetary resource allocation (n = 15), and rating scale measures of reward availability and experience (n = 8). The available research suggests that, consistent with experimental laboratory research and with behavioral economic predictions, there is an inverse relation between substance-free reinforcement and substance use. These studies also support the clinical utility of these measures in predicting substance use severity and course. Reinforcement measures could be improved by enhancing content validity, multimethod convergent validity, and generalizability."
Measuring patient-centered care: An updated systematic review of how studies define and report concordance between patients' preferences and medical treatments	"OBJECTIVE: The purpose was to examine recent advances in measuring value concordance and to highlight best practices. METHODS: The paper updates a prior systematic review. A systematic review of the literature from 2008 to 2012 identified articles that reported a relationship between patients' preferences concerning health outcomes and/or medical treatments, and treatment (intended or actual). Relevant articles were independently abstracted by two reviewers. RESULTS: The search identified 3635 unique citations, the full text of 187 articles was examined, and 63 articles covering 61 studies were included, nearly a third more articles than identified in the original review. There were 72 different value concordance calculations, the majority of which were clearly reported with significance. More studies assessed knowledge, reported on the association between value concordance and knowledge, and included a decision aid compared to those in the original review. CONCLUSION: There is increased reporting of value concordance in the literature. However, large differences exist in the way that the measure is defined and calculated. The variability makes it difficult to draw conclusions about the quality of care across studies. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Value concordance is a critical component of patient-centered care, and further attention is needed to establish standards for measurement and reporting.

Measuring quality of life among people living with HIV: a systematic review of reviews	"AIM: A systematic review of reviews was conducted to identify and appraise brief measures of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) that have been used in peer-reviewed research with people living with HIV. METHODS: The review was conducted in two stages: 1) search of electronic databases to identify systematic reviews of tools used to measure HRQoL in adults living with HIV, published since the year 2000; 2) selection of HRQol scales from those identified in the reviews. Inclusion criteria included scales that could be self-administered in 10 min or less, covering at least 3 domains of quality of life (physical function, social/role function and mental/emotional function). For generic scales, inclusion criteria included the availability of normative data while for HIV-specific scales, patient input into the development of the scale was required. RESULTS: Ten reviews met the inclusion criteria. Nine generic scales met the inclusion criteria: the EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D); Health Utilities Index; McGill Quality of Life questionnaire; Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Short Form (SF)-12; SF-36; World Health Organisation Quality of Life (WHOQOL- BREF), Questions of Life Satisfaction (FLZM) and SF-20. Available psychometric data supported the EQ-5D and SF-36. Seven HIV-specific scales met the inclusion criteria: the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)-21; HIV-QL-31; MOS-HIV; Multidimensional Quality of Life Questionnaire for Persons with HIV/AIDS (MQOL-HIV), PROQOL-HIV, Symptom Quality of Life Adherence (HIV-SQUAD) and the WHOQOL-HIV BREF. Of the HIV -specific measures, the MOS-HIV was considered to have the most well-established psychometric properties, however limitations identified in the reviews included insufficient input from people living with HIV in the development of the scale, cross-cultural relevance and continued applicability. Two relatively new measures, the WHOQOL-HIV BREF and PROQOL-HIV, were considered to have promising psychometric properties and may have more relevance to people living with HIV. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the need for further validation of HRQoL measures in people living with HIV. The choice of one measure over another is likely to be influenced by the purpose of the quality of life assessment and the domains of HRQoL that are most relevant to the specific research or clinical question."
Measuring social exclusion in healthcare settings: a scoping review	"BACKGROUND: Social exclusion is a concept that has been widely debated in recent years; a particular focus of the discussion has been its significance in relation to health. The meanings of the phrase ""social exclusion"", and the closely associated term ""social inclusion"", are contested in the literature. Both of these concepts are important in relation to health and the area of primary healthcare in particular. Thus, several tools for the measurement of social exclusion or social inclusion status in health care settings have been developed. METHODS: A scoping review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted to examine tools developed since 2000 that measure social exclusion or social inclusion. We focused on those measurement tools developed for use with individual patients in healthcare settings. Efforts were made to obtain a copy of each of the original tools, and all relevant background literature. All tools retrieved were compared in tables, and the specific domains that were included in each measure were tabulated. RESULTS: Twenty-two measurement tools were included in the final scoping review. The majority of these had been specifically developed for the measurement of social inclusion or social exclusion, but a small number were created for the measurement of other closely aligned concepts. The majority of the tools included were constructed for engaging with patients in mental health settings. The tools varied greatly in their design, the scoring systems and the ways they were administered. The domains covered by these tools varied widely and some of the tools were quite narrow in the areas of focus. A review of the definitions of both social inclusion and social exclusion also revealed the variations among the explanations of these complex concepts. CONCLUSIONS: There are several definitions of both social inclusion and social exclusion in use and they differ greatly in scope. While there are many tools that have been developed for measuring these concepts in healthcare settings, these do not have a primary healthcare focus. There is a need for the development of a tool for measuring social inclusion or social exclusion in primary healthcare settings."
Measuring stigma affecting sex workers (SW) and men who have sex with men (MSM): A systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Stigma involves discrediting a person or group based on a perceived attribute, behaviour or reputation associated with them. Sex workers (SW) and men who have sex with men (MSM) are key populations who are often at increased risk for the acquisition and transmission of HIV and who are affected by stigma that can negatively impact their health and well-being. Although stigma was included as an indicator in the US National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan and there have been consultations focused on adding a stigma indicator within PEPFAR and the Global Fund in relation to potentiating HIV risks among key populations, there remains limited consensus on the appropriate measurement of SW- or MSM-associated stigma. Consequently, this systematic review summarizes studies using quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods approaches to measure stigma affecting sex workers and men who have sex with men. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This systematic review included English, French, and Spanish peer-reviewed research of any study design measuring SW- or MSM-associated stigma. Articles were published from January 1, 2004 to March 26, 2014 in PsycINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, Global Health, and World Health Organization Global Health Library Regional Indexes. Of the 541 articles reviewed, the majority measured stigma toward MSM (over 97%), were conducted in North America, used quantitative methods, and focused on internalized stigma. CONCLUSIONS: With the inclusion of addressing stigma in several domestic and international HIV strategies, there is a need to ensure the use of validated metrics for stigma. The field to date has completed limited measurement of stigma affecting sex workers, and limited measurement of stigma affecting MSM outside of higher income settings. Moving forward requires a concerted effort integrating validated metrics of stigma into health-related surveys and programs for key populations."
Medication-taking experiences in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review.	"Background: Although attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition for which pharmacotherapy is considered an effective treatment, guidelines on the treatment of ADHD have been challenging to implement. Considering the views of patients and caregivers involved in medication-taking could help shed light on these challenges. Objective: This review combines the findings of individual studies of medication-taking experiences in ADHD in order to guide clinicians to effectively share decisions about treatment. Methods: Five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, SCOPUS and CINAHL) were systematically searched for relevant published research articles. Articles were assessed for quality using a Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist, and synthesis was performed using meta-ethnography. Results: Thirty-one articles were included in the final synthesis, comprising studies of caregivers, paediatric patients and adult patients across seven countries. Findings were categorized into five different constructs, including coming to terms with ADHD, anticipated concerns about medication, experiences of the effects of medication, external influences and the development of self-management. The synthesis demonstrates that decisions surrounding medication-taking for ADHD evolve as the child patient enters adulthood and moves towards autonomy and self-management. In all parts of this journey, decisions are shaped by a series of 'trade-offs', where potential benefits and harms of medication are weighed up. Conclusions: This review offers a comprehensive insight into medication-taking experiences in ADHD. By considering the shifting locus of decision-making over time and the need for individuals and families to reconcile a variety of external influences, primary care and mental health clinicians can engage in holistic conversations with their patients to share decisions effectively."
Meditation for asthma: Systematic review and meta-analysis.	"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of meditation on a variety of asthma outcomes. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and AMED in June 2016 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effectiveness of meditation in adults with asthma. No restriction was put on language or year of publication. Study quality was assessed using The Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Meta-analysis was carried out using RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: Four RCTs involving 201 patients met the inclusion criteria. Quality of studies was inconsistent with only one study reporting adequate allocation concealment. Disease-specific quality of life was assessed in two trials; a pooled result involving 62 intervention and 65 control participants indicated a significant improvement in quality of life in the meditation group compared to the control group (SMD 0.40, 95% CI 0.05-0.76). A pooled result from all four studies indicated the uncertain effect of meditation in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (SMD -0.67, 95% CI -2.17 to 0.82). Results from the individual trials suggest that meditation may be helpful in reducing perceived stress and the use of short-term rescue medication. CONCLUSION: Our review suggests that there is some evidence that meditation is beneficial in improving quality of life in asthma patients. As two out of four studies in our review were of poor quality, further trials with better methodological quality are needed to support or refute this finding."
Mental health and wellbeing during the transition to fatherhood: a systematic review of first time fathers' experiences.	"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to identify and synthesize the best available evidence on first time fathers' experiences and needs in relation to their mental health and wellbeing during their transition to fatherhood. INTRODUCTION: Men's mental health and wellbeing during their transition to fatherhood is an important public health issue that is currently under-researched from a qualitative perspective and poorly understood. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Resident first time fathers (biological and non-biological) of healthy babies born with no identified terminal or long-term conditions were included. The phenomena of interest were their experiences and needs in relation to mental health and wellbeing during their transition to fatherhood, from commencement of pregnancy until one year after birth. Studies based on qualitative data, including, but not limited to, designs within phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography and action research were included. METHODS: A three-step search strategy was used. The search strategy explored published and unpublished qualitative studies from 1960 to September 2017. All included studies were assessed by two independent reviewers and any disagreements were resolved by consensus or with a third reviewer. The recommended Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) approach to critical appraisal, study selection, data extraction and data synthesis was used. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review, which were then assessed to be of moderate to high quality (scores 5-10) based on the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research. The studies were published between 1990 and 2017, and all used qualitative methodologies to accomplish the overall aim of investigating the experiences of expectant or new fathers. Nine studies were from the UK, three from Sweden, three from Australia, two from Canada, two from the USA, one from Japan, one from Taiwan and one from Singapore. The total number of first time fathers included in the studies was 351. One hundred and forty-four findings were extracted from the included studies. Of these, 142 supported findings were aggregated into 23 categories and seven synthesized findings: 1) New fatherhood identity, 2) Competing challenges of new fatherhood, 3) Negative feelings and fears, 4) Stress and coping, 5) Lack of support, 6) What new fathers want, and 7) Positive aspects of fatherhood. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the synthesized findings, three main factors that affect first time fathers' mental health and wellbeing during their transition to fatherhood were identified: the formation of the fatherhood identity, competing challenges of the new fatherhood role and negative feelings and fears relating to it. The role restrictions and changes in lifestyle often resulted in feelings of stress, for which fathers used denial or escape activities, such as smoking, working longer hours or listening to music, as coping techniques. Fathers wanted more guidance and support around the preparation for fatherhood, and partner relationship changes. Barriers to accessing support included lack of tailored information resources and acknowledgment from health professionals. Better preparation for fatherhood, and support for couple relationships during the transition to parenthood could facilitate better experiences for new fathers, and contribute to better adjustments and mental wellbeing in new fathers."
Mental health impact of social capital interventions: a systematic review	"PURPOSE: Mental disorders are a major contributor to the global burden of disease and disability, and can be extremely costly at both individual and community level. Social capital, (SC) defined as an individual's social relationships and participation in community networks, may lower the risk of mental disorders while increasing resilience capacity, adaptation and recovery. SC interventions may be a cost-effective way of preventing and ameliorating these conditions. However, the impact of these SC interventions on mental health still needs research. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of SC-based interventions to investigate their effect on mental health outcomes from controlled, quasi-experimental studies or pilot trials. We searched twelve academic databases, three clinical trials registries, hand-searched references and contacted field experts. Studies' quality was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tools for randomized and non-randomized studies. RESULTS: Seven studies were included in the review, published between 2006 and 2016. There was substantial heterogeneity in the definitions of both SC and mental disorders among the studies, preventing us from calculating pooled effect sizes. The interventions included community engagement and educative programs, cognitive processing therapy and sociotherapy for trauma survivors, and neighbourhood projects. CONCLUSIONS: There are paucity of SC interventions investigating the effect on mental health outcomes. This study showed that both SC scores and mental health outcomes improved over time but there was little evidence of benefit compared to control groups in the long term. Further high-quality trials are needed, especially among adverse populations to assess sustainability of effect."
Mental health interventions during ventricular assist device therapy: a scoping review.	"OBJECTIVES: Because of the high prevalence of psychological disorders among ventricular assist device patients, mental health support is consensually recommended. No study as yet has provided an overview of recommended and reported mental health interventions. This article presents the results of a scoping review on these questions. METHODS: We searched standard databases for relevant search criteria and found 4 consensus guidelines and 13 publications with original research mentioning mental health interventions for ventricular assist device patients. These publications are synthesized and augmented with practical recommendations from our reports and from a single-centre experience of others. RESULTS: Consensus guidelines recommend mental health interventions in 4 areas: screening and diagnostics, assessment, support and treatment and education. Interventions vary across treatment phases and by device therapy strategy, as do typical sources of mental distress. A flow chart of interventions over the course of treatment summarizes these findings. CONCLUSIONS: The delivery of consensually recommended mental health support for ventricular assist device patients involves the performance of multiple, complex tasks that vary across treatment phases. Mental health professionals should have specialized skills and should interact frequently with other caregivers in care teams."
Mental Health Needs of People Who Identify as Transgender: A Review of the Literature	"Transgender people face many challenges in society including accessing and using healthcare systems. However, little is known about the specific mental health service needs and concerns of transgender people in this regard. The aim of the study was to establish the mental health sen/ice needs of transgender people through a review of relevant studies that address the experiences and views of this group. A comprehensive search of CINHAL, Cochrane, Google Scholar, PubMed, Psychlnfo, PsychLit, Sociological Abstracts, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from inception to January 2014 was conducted. Studies were identified that met specific criteria that included: using qualitative methods, involving transgender people, and addressing issues related to mental health services. The search yielded 217 papers in total. Following the application of rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria 33 papers were included for retrieval. Finally, 10 papers were considered suitable for the review. The data were analyzed and key themes identified. The review highlighted distinct challenges that exist in terms of mental health service provision. These included accessing appropriate services and treatments, responsiveness of practitioner's, the provision of family supports and potential mental health service developments. The review findings are discussed and key recommendations are made in terms of mental health nursing practice developments, education and research."
"Mental health nurses"" attitudes, behaviour, experience and knowledge regarding adults with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder: Systematic, integrative literature review"	"Aims and objectives: To establish whether mental health nurses responses to people with borderline personality disorder are problematic and, if so, to inform solutions to support change. Background: There is some evidence that people diagnosed with borderline personality disorder are unpopular among mental health nurses who respond to them in ways which could be counter-therapeutic. Interventions to improve nurses"" attitudes have had limited success. Design: Systematic, integrative literature review. Methods: Computerised databases were searched from inception to April 2015 for papers describing primary research focused on mental health nurses"" attitudes, behaviour, experience, and knowledge regarding adults diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Analysis of qualitative studies employed metasynthesis; analysis of quantitative studies was informed by the theory of planned behaviour. Results: Forty studies were included. Only one used direct observation of clinical practice. Nurses"" knowledge and experiences vary widely. They find the group very challenging to work with, report having many training needs, and, objectively, their attitudes are poorer than other professionals"" and poorer than towards other diagnostic groups. Nurses say they need a coherent therapeutic framework to guide their practice, and their experience of caregiving seems improved where this exists. Conclusions: Mental health nurses"" responses to people with borderline personality disorder are sometimes counter-therapeutic. As interventions to change them have had limited success there is a need for fresh thinking. Observational research to better understand the link between attitudes and clinical practice is required. Evidence-based education about borderline personality disorder is necessary, but developing nurses to lead in the design, implementation and teaching of coherent therapeutic frameworks may have greater benefits. Relevance to clinical practice: There should be greater focus on development and implementation of a team-wide approach, with nurses as equal partners, when working with patients with borderline personality disorder.

Mental health promotion and problem prevention in schools: what does the evidence say?	"The European Union Dataprev project reviewed work on mental health in four areas, parenting, schools, the workplace and older people. The schools workpackage carried out a systematic review of reviews of work on mental health in schools from which it identified evidence-based interventions and programmes and extracted the general principles from evidence-based work. A systematic search of the literature uncovered 52 systematic reviews and meta-analyses of mental health in schools. The interventions identified by the reviews had a wide range of beneficial effects on children, families and communities and on a range of mental health, social, emotional and educational outcomes. The effect sizes associated with most interventions were generally small to moderate in statistical terms, but large in terms of real-world impacts. The effects associated with interventions were variable and their effectiveness could not always be relied on. The characteristics of more effective interventions included: teaching skills, focusing on positive mental health; balancing universal and targeted approaches; starting early with the youngest children and continuing with older ones; operating for a lengthy period of time and embedding work within a multi-modal/whole-school approach which included such features as changes to the curriculum including teaching skills and linking with academic learning, improving school ethos, teacher education, liaison with parents, parenting education, community involvement and coordinated work with outside agencies. Interventions were only effective if they were completely and accurately implemented: this applied particularly to whole-school interventions which could be ineffective if not implemented with clarity, intensity and fidelity. The implications for policy and practice around mental health in schools are discussed, including the suggestion of some rebalancing of priorities and emphases."
Mental Health Researchers' Views About Service User Research: A Literature Review.	"Services users are becoming actively involved in mental health research. How this is perceived by other researchers is not well known. The aim of this article is to review the international literature exploring other mental health researchers' views of service users conducting research, between 1996 and 2016. Searches of multiple databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Google Scholar) were undertaken. Combinations of terms related to service user research and mental health researcher perspectives, views, and attitudes were used. Manual inquiry of reference lists was also undertaken. Relevant papers were coded by topic, location, study design, and other dimensions. Five articles met inclusion criteria. Most referred to perceived benefits, such as greater validity of research findings, challenges of collaborating with service users, and the validity of research findings. There was some evidence of more openness to mental health service users providing suggestions, preferably in early stages of the research process. Reluctance to co-research with service users was reported. There is limited research directly addressing other mental health researchers' views about service user research; barriers to inclusion (whether involvement, co-production or user-controlled) and creating incongruence with health policy statements. Further research to more fully understand these attitudes and how they might be influenced is warranted."
"Mental health service user involvement in research: where have we come from, where are we going?"	"Purpose -- The aim of the research is to assess the extent and value of mental health service user (MHSU) involvement in research in England. Design/methodology/approach -- This is a knowledge review, including academic and 'grey' literature, and documented testimonial evidence. Findings -- The involvement of MHSUs in mental health research has become mainstream. There is clear evidence that involving MHSUs in research adds value. Four gaps in the literature were identified. First, a lack of evidence from non-service-user researchers about their experience of working with MHSUs. Second, a lack of recognition that anyone involved in research may hold more than one role. Third, failure to treat carers as separate from MHSUs, or -- often -- to include them at all. Fourth, a lack of understanding that MHSUs may have a useful role to play in research on topics other than mental health. Research limitations/implications -- The literature would benefit from some evidence about non-serviceuser researchers' experiences of working with MHSU researchers. Carers should be recognised much more widely as different from MHSUs and with a valid role to play in mental health research from their own perspectives. MHSU researchers, and carer researchers, should be offered opportunities for involvement in research on topics other than mental health. Practical implications -- The evidence shows that involving service users in research can benefit everyone involved and the research itself. The process can be challenging for all concerned. However, there is now plenty of guidance about how to involve service users in research for maximum benefit to all (e.g. Faulkner, 2004b; SURGE, 2005; Morgan, 2006; Tew et al., 2006; Kotecha et al., 2007; Schrank and Wallcraft, 2008, pp. 243-247; Leiba, 2010, pp. 160-169; Armes et al., 2011; Morrow et al., 2012, p. 114). This guidance should be consulted by researchers, funders, ethics committees, and other stakeholders at the earliest possible stage of any relevant project. Social implications -- It is essential to recognise and acknowledge that anyone involved in research may hold more than one role. Embracing multiple and mutable identities is not an easy process, as the literature shows, and attempts to do so are likely to produce resistance at every level. Nevertheless, the example of the survivor researchers suggests that doing this has the potential to enrich our individual and collective experience, and therefore society as a whole. Originality/value -- The paper is written by an independent researcher who is also a carer for people with mental health problems: a viewpoint which is rarely found in the literature. The literature suggests that power imbalances and identity issues are at the root of most difficulties and gaps. Social identity and categorisation theory offers a useful theoretical perspective. The paper will be of value to anyone interested in mental health research, whether as a student, service user/survivor, researcher or teacher."
Mental health service users' experiences of mental health care: an integrative literature review	"Accessible summary A number of studies have highlighted issues around the relationship between service users and providers. The recovery model is predominant in mental health as is the recognition of the importance of person-centred practice. The authors completed an in-depth search of the literature to answer the question: What are service users' experiences of the mental health service?, Three key themes emerged: acknowledging a mental health problem and seeking help; building relationships through participation in care; and working towards continuity of care., The review adds to the current body of knowledge by providing greater detail into the importance of relationships between service users and providers and how these may impact on the delivery of care in the mental health service. The overarching theme that emerged was the importance of the relationship between the service user and provider as a basis for interaction and support., This review has specific implications for mental health nursing. Despite the recognition made in policy documents for change, issues with stigma, poor attitudes and communication persist. There is a need for a fundamental shift in the provider-service user relationship to facilitate true service-user engagement in their care., Abstract The aim of this integrative literature review was to identify mental health service users' experiences of services. The rationale for this review was based on the growing emphasis and requirements for health services to deliver care and support, which recognizes the preferences of individuals. Contemporary models of mental health care strive to promote inclusion and empowerment. This review seeks to add to our current understanding of how service users experience care and support in order to determine to what extent the principles of contemporary models of mental health care are embedded in practice. A robust search of Web of Science, the Cochrane Database, Science Direct, EBSCO host ( Academic Search Complete, MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus Full- Text), Psyc INFO, Psyc ARTICLES, Social Sciences Full Text and the United Kingdom and Ireland Reference Centre for data published between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2012 was completed. The initial search retrieved 272 609 papers. The authors used a staged approach and the application of predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria, thus the numbers of papers for inclusion were reduced to 34. Data extraction, quality assessment and thematic analysis were completed for the included studies. Satisfaction with the mental health service was moderately good. However, accessing services could be difficult because of a lack of knowledge and the stigma surrounding mental health. Large surveys document moderate satisfaction ratings; however, feelings of fear regarding how services function and the lack of treatment choice remain. The main finding from this review is while people may express satisfaction with mental health services, there are still issues around three main themes: acknowledging a mental health problem and seeking help; building relationship through participation and care; and working towards continuity of care. Elements of the recovery model appear to be lacking in relation to user involvement, empowerment and decision making. There is a need for a fundamental shift in the context of the provider-service user relationship to fully facilitate service users' engagement in their care."
Mental health services assessment in Brazil: systematic literature review	"Assessment in the mental health area is a mechanism able to generate information that positively helps decision-making. Therefore, it is necessary to appropriate on the existing discussions, reasoning the challenges and possibilities linked to knowledge production within this scientific filed. A systematic review of publications about the Brazilian scientific production on mental health service assessment was performed, identifying and discussing methods, assessment perspectives and results. The search for articles was done in IBECS, Lilacs and Scielo databases, considering the publication of Federal Law 10.216. Thirty-five articles were selected based on the used terms and on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Scientific production in this field is concentrated in the South and Southwest regions and holds different scopes and participants. Such wide range of possibilities is adopted as a way to help improving services and decision-making processes in mental health care. Advances in humanized, participative and community care are highlighted, but requiring more investments, professional qualification and organizational improvements. It is postulated greater integration among research, with evaluations going beyond structural aspects and the comparison with hospitalocentric models."
Mentoring adolescents to prevent drug and alcohol use.	"Background Many adolescents receive mentoring. There is no systematic review if mentoring prevents alcohol and drug use. Objectives Assess effectiveness of mentoring to prevent adolescent alcohol/drug use. Search methods Cochrane CENTRAL (issue 4), MEDLINE (1950-to July 2011), EMBASE (1980-to July 2011), 5 other electronic and 11 Grey literature electronic databases, 10 websites, reference lists, experts in addictions and mentoring. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of mentoring in adolescents to prevent alcohol/drug use. Data collection and analysis We identified 2,113 abstracts, independently assessed 233 full-text articles, 4 RCTs met inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risks of bias. We contacted investigators for missing information. Main results We identified 4 RCTs (1,194 adolescents). No RCT reported enough detail to assess whether a strong randomisation method was used or allocation was concealed. Blinding was not possible as the intervention was mentoring. Three RCTs provided complete data. No selective reporting. Authors' conclusions All four RCTs were in the US, and included ""deprived"" and mostly minority adolescents. Participants were young (in two studies age 12, and in two others 9-16). All students at baseline were non-users of alcohol and drugs. Two RCTs found mentoring reduced the rate of initiation of alcohol, and one of drug usage. The ability of the interventions to be effective was limited by the low rates of commencing alcohol and drug use during the intervention period in two studies (the use of marijuana in one study increased to 1% in the experimental and to 1.6% in the control group, and in another study drug usage rose to 6% in the experimental and 11% in the control group). However, in a third study there was scope for the intervention to have an effect as alcohol use rose to 19% in the experimental and 27% in the control group. The studies assessed structured programmes and not informal mentors."
Meta-analysis of clinical trials examining the benefit of structured home exercise in patients with peripheral artery disease	"BACKGROUND: Supervised exercise is recommended for the management of peripheral artery disease (PAD); however, the uptake is limited. Structured home exercise programmes may be more feasible, but their effectiveness is unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the benefit of structured home exercise programmes for treating PAD in comparison to controls not receiving an exercise programme. METHODS: A literature search was conducted to identify RCTs comparing structured home exercise with controls not receiving an exercise programme among patients with PAD. To be included, studies had to report outcomes from treadmill or corridor walking tests, or objective assessment of physical activity. Inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis was performed to compare changes in maximum walking distance and intermittent claudication onset distance in treadmill tests, walking distance during a 6-min walking test, and physical activity measured using a pedometer or accelerometer. Summarized results are presented in terms of standard deviation differences. RESULTS: Eleven randomized trials involving 807 patients were included. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 24 months; only one trial included follow-up beyond 12 months. Meta-analyses showed that structured home exercise programmes led to significant improvements in maximum walking distance (mean difference (MD) 0.32, 95 per cent c.i. 0.15 to 0.50; P < 0.001), intermittent claudication onset distance (MD 0.45, 0.27 to 0.62; P < 0.001), walking distance in a 6-min walking test (MD 0.28, 0.09 to 0.47; P = 0.004) and physical activity (MD 0.27, 0.11 to 0.43; P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that structured home exercise programmes are effective at improving walking performance and physical activity in the short term for patients with PAD.

Meta-analysis of relationships between religiosity and constructive and destructive behaviors among adolescents	"In view of the substantial number of recent studies on relationships between religious involvement and constructive or destructive behavior among adolescents, it is time to consolidate knowledge about these relationships through a meta-analysis. The meta-analysis conducted in this study involves 40 studies published from 1995 to 2009, covering adolescents with an average age of 16.45 years. Results show a weak overall effect (Zr = .19). Moreover, religious involvement exhibits a stronger relationship with constructive behavior than with destructive behavior. Compared with private religious involvement, public religious involvement shows a weaker relationship with constructive or destructive behaviors. Furthermore, non-representative sampling generates a stronger relationship than does representative sampling. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Metasynthesis of the views about treatment of anorexia nervosa in adolescents: Perspectives of adolescents, parents, and professionals."	"Background Anorexia nervosa in adolescents can be a difficult-To-Treat disease. Because qualitative research is a well-established method for deepening our understanding of subjective experiences, such as eating disorders and their treatment, we sought to perform a systematic review of qualitative studies to synthesize the views of adolescents with this disease, their parents, and their healthcare providers about its treatment. Methods We performed a thematic synthesis to develop the central themes that summarize all of the topics raised in the articles included in our review. The quality of the articles was assessed by the Critical Appraisal Skills Program. Results We included 32 articles from seven different countries. Two central themes were inductively developed from the analysis: (1) the treatment targets (i.e., symptoms and patients in context), and (2) a therapeutic toola relationship, specifically the core concept of the therapeutic relationship. Conclusion Our results underline the difficulty in establishing a therapeutic alliance, the barriers to it, especially the risk that professionals, adolescents, and parents will not converse about treatment; although such a dialogue appears to be an essential component in the construction of a therapeutic alliance."
Methadone maintenance treatment participant retention and behavioural effectiveness in China: a systematic review and meta-analysis	"BACKGROUND: Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) has been scaled up by the Chinese government alongside persistent compulsory drug user detention, but the extent to which detention interferes with MMT is unknown. The study systematically reviews Chinese MMT retention rates, reasons for drop out, and behavioural changes. METHOD: Chinese and English databases of literature are searched for studies reporting retention rates, drug use and sexual behaviours among MMT participants in China between 2004 and 2013. The estimates are summarized through a systematic review and meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 74 studies representing 43,263 individuals are included in this analysis. About a third of MMT participants drop out during the first three months of treatment (retention rate 69.0% (95% CI 57.7-78.4%)). Police arrest and detention in compulsory rehabilitation was the most common cause of drop out, accounting for 22.2% of all those not retained. Among retained participants, changing unsafe drug use behaviours was more effective than changing unsafe sexual behaviours. At 12 months following MMT initiation, 24.6% (15.7-33.5%) of MMT participants had a positive urine test, 9.3% (4.7-17.8%) injected drugs and only 1.1% (0.4-3.0%) sold sex for drugs. These correspond to 0.002 (<0.001-0.011), 0.045 (0.004-0.114) and 0.209 (0.076-0.580) times lower odds than baseline. However, MMT participants did not have substantial changes in condom use rates. CONCLUSION: MMT is effective in drug users in China but participant retention is poor, substantially related to compulsory detention. Reforming the compulsory drug user detention system may improve MMT retention and effectiveness."
Methodological and Reporting Quality of Comparative Studies Evaluating Health-Related Quality of Life of Colorectal Cancer Patients and Controls: A Systematic Review	"BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life is an important outcome measure in patients with colorectal cancer. Comparison with normative data has been increasingly undertaken to assess the additional impact of colorectal cancer on health-related quality of life. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to critically appraise the methodological details and reporting characteristics of comparative studies evaluating differences in health-related quality of life between patients and controls. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of English-language literature published between January 1985 and May 2014 was conducted through a database search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Medline. STUDY SELECTION: Comparative studies reporting health-related quality-of-life outcomes among patients who have colorectal cancer and controls were selected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Methodological and reporting quality per comparison study was evaluated based on a 11-item methodological checklist proposed by Efficace in 2003 and a set of criteria predetermined by reviewers. RESULTS: Thirty-one comparative studies involving >10,000 patients and >10,000 controls were included. Twenty-three studies (74.2%) originated from European countries, with the largest number from the Netherlands (n = 6). Twenty-eight studies (90.3%) compared the health-related quality of life of patients with normative data published elsewhere, whereas the remaining studies recruited a group of patients who had colorectal cancer and a group of control patients within the same studies. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Core 30 was the most extensively used instrument (n = 16; 51.6%). Eight studies (25.8%) were classified as ""probably robust"" for clinical decision making according to the Efficace standard methodological checklist. Our further quality assessment revealed the lack of score differences reported (61.3%), contemporary comparisons (36.7%), statistical significance tested (38.7%), and matching of control group (58.1%), possibly leading to inappropriate control groups for fair comparisons. LIMITATIONS: Meta-analysis of differences between the 2 groups was not available. CONCLUSIONS: In general, one-fourth of comparative studies that evaluated health-related quality of life of patients who had colorectal cancer achieved high quality in reporting characteristics and methodological details. Future studies are encouraged to undertake health-related quality-of-life measurement and adhere to a methodological checklist in comparison with controls."
"Methods of consumer involvement in developing healthcare policy and research, clinical practice guidelines and patient information material."	"Background The importance of consumer involvement in health care is widely recognised. Consumers can be involved in developing healthcare policy and research, clinical practice guidelines and patient information material, through consultations to elicit their views or through collaborative processes. Consultations can be single events, or repeated events, large or small scale. They can involve individuals or groups of consumers to allow debate; the groups may be convened especially for the consultation or be established consumer organisations. They can be organised in different forums and through different media. Objectives To assess the effects of consumer involvement and compare different methods of involvement in developing healthcare policy and research, clinical practice guidelines, and patient information material. Search methods For the 2006 version of this review () we searched: the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group's Specialised Register (4 May 2006); the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane LibraryIssue 1 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to January Week 2 2006); EMBASE (1980 to Week 03 2006); CINAHL (1982 to December Week 2 2005), PsycINFO (1806 to January Week 3 2006); Sociological Abstracts (1952 to 24 January 2006); and SIGLE (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (1980 to 2003/1). We scanned reference lists from relevant articles and contacted authors. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials assessing methods for involving consumers in developing healthcare policy and research, clinical practice guidelines or patient information material. The outcome measures were: participation or response rates of consumers; consumer views elicited; consumer influence on decisions, healthcare outcomes or resource utilisation; consumers' or professionals' satisfaction with the involvement process or resulting products; impact on the participating consumers; costs. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed their quality and extracted data. We contacted trial authors for clarification and to seek missing data. We presented results in a narrative summary and pooled data as appropriate. Main results We included six randomised controlled trials with moderate or high risk of bias, involving 2123 participants. There is moderate quality evidence that involving consumers in the development of patient information material results in material that is more relevant, readable and understandable to patients, without affecting their anxiety. This 'consumer-informed' material can also improve patients' knowledge. There is low quality evidence that using consumer interviewers instead of staff interviewers in satisfaction surveys can have a small influence on the survey results. There is low quality evidence that an informed consent document developed with consumer input (potential trial participants) may have little if any impact on understanding compared to a consent document developed by trial investigators only. There is very low quality evidence that telephone discussions and face-to-face group meetings engage consumers better than mailed surveys in order to set priorities for community health goals. They also result in different priorities being set for these goals. Authors' conclusions There is little evidence from randomised controlled trials of the effects of consumer involvement in healthcare decisions at the population level. The trials included in this review demonstrate that randomised controlled trials are feasible for providing evidence about the effects of involving consumers in these decisions."
Migrant health research in the Republic of Ireland: a scoping review	"BACKGROUND: Migration to European countries has increased in number and diversity in recent years. Factors such as access to healthcare, language barriers and legal status can impact the health outcomes of migrant groups. However, little is known about the evidence base on the health status of migrants in the Republic of Ireland. Our aim was to scope existing peer-reviewed research on the health of migrants in Ireland and identify any gaps in the evidence. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed research on the health of migrants in the Republic of Ireland. Eleven electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed, empirical articles published between 2001 and 2017. Search terms were adapted from a World Health Organisation review. Findings were analysed using the 2016 World Health Organisation Strategy and Action Plan for Refugee and Migrant Health in the World Health Organisation European region, which outlines nine strategic areas that require collaborative action. RESULTS: Of 9396 articles retrieved, 80 met inclusion criteria, with the majority (81%) published since 2009. More than half of the studies had a quantitative design (65%). Migrants studied came from Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa and included labour migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. Most studies related to two World Health Organisation strategic areas; 4: ""achieving public health preparedness and ensuring an effective response"", and 5: ""strengthening health systems and their resilience"". CONCLUSION: There is growing attention to migrant health in Ireland with a balance of qualitative and quantitative research. While much of the identified research is relevant to three of the World Health Organisation strategic areas, there are significant gaps in the other six areas. The study design could be replicated in other countries to examine and inform migrant health research."
Mind and body therapy for fibromyalgia.	"Background Mind-body interventions are based on the holistic principle that mind, body and behaviour are all interconnected. Mind-body interventions incorporate strategies that are thought to improve psychological and physical well-being, aim to allow patients to take an active role in their treatment, and promote people's ability to cope. Mind-body interventions are widely used by people with fibromyalgia to help manage their symptoms and improve well-being. Examples of mind-body therapies include psychological therapies, biofeedback, mindfulness, movement therapies and relaxation strategies. Objectives To review the benefits and harms of mind-body therapies in comparison to standard care and attention placebo control groups for adults with fibromyalgia, post-intervention and at three and six month follow-up. Search methods Electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), AMED (EBSCO) and CINAHL (Ovid) were conducted up to 30 October 2013. Searches of reference lists were conducted and authors in the field were contacted to identify additional relevant articles. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of mind-body interventions for adults with fibromyalgia were included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies, extracted the data and assessed trials for low, unclear or high risk of bias. Any discrepancy was resolved through discussion and consensus. Continuous outcomes were analysed using mean difference (MD) where the same outcome measure and scoring method was used and standardised mean difference (SMD) where different outcome measures were used. For binary data standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was used. Main results Seventy-four papers describing 61 trials were identified, with 4234 predominantly female participants. The nature of fibromyalgia varied from mild to severe across the study populations. Twenty-six studies were classified as having a low risk of bias for all domains assessed. The findings of mind-body therapies compared with usual care were prioritised. Authors' conclusions Psychological interventions therapies may be effective in improving physical functioning, pain and low mood for adults with fibromyalgia in comparison to usual care controls but the quality of the evidence is low. Further research on the outcomes of therapies is needed to determine if positive effects identified post-intervention are sustained. The effectiveness of biofeedback, mindfulness, movement therapies and relaxation based therapies remains unclear as the quality of the evidence was very low or low. The small number of trials and inconsistency in the use of outcome measures across the trials restricted the analysis."
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for Treating Low Back Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis	"Background: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is frequently used to treat pain-related conditions, but its effects on low back pain are uncertain. Purpose: To assess the efficacy and safety of MBSR in patients with low back pain. Data Sources: Searches of MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO to 15 June 2016. Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared MBSR with usual care or an active comparator and assessed pain intensity or pain-related disability as a primary outcome in patients with low back pain. Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, patients, interventions, outcome measures, and results at short- and long-term follow-up. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Data Synthesis: Seven RCTs involving 864 patients with low back pain were eligible for review. Compared with usual care, MBSR was associated with short-term improvements in pain intensity (4 RCTs; mean difference MD], -0.96 point on a numerical rating scale 95% CI, -1.64 to -0.34 point]; standardized mean difference SMD], -0.48 point CI, -0.82 to -0.14 point]) and physical functioning (2 RCTs; MD, 2.50 CI, 0.90 to 4.10 point]; SMD, 0.25 CI, 0.09 to 0.41 point]) that were not sustained in the long term. Between-group differences in disability, mental health, pain acceptance, and mindfulness were not significant at short- or long-term follow-up. Compared with an active comparator, MBSR was not associated with significant differences in short- or long-term outcomes. No serious adverse events were reported. Limitation: The number of eligible RCTs was limited; only 3 evaluated MBSR against an active comparator. Conclusion: Mindfulness-based stress reduction may be associated with short-term effects on pain intensity and physical functioning. Long-term RCTs that compare MBSR versus active treatments are needed in order to best understand the role of MBSR in the management of low back pain. Primary Funding Source: None."
Mirror therapy for improving motor function after stroke.	"Background Mirror therapy is used to improve motor function after stroke. During mirror therapy, a mirror is placed in the person's midsagittal plane, thus reflecting movements of the non-paretic side as if it were the affected side. Objectives To summarise the effectiveness of mirror therapy compared with no treatment, placebo or sham therapy, or other treatments for improving motor function and motor impairment after stroke. We also aimed to assess the effects of mirror therapy on activities of daily living, pain, and visuospatial neglect. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, PsycINFO and PEDro (last searched 16 August 2017). We also handsearched relevant conference proceedings, trials and research registers, checked reference lists, and contacted trialists, researchers and experts in our field of study. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and randomised cross-over trials comparing mirror therapy with any control intervention for people after stroke. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials based on the inclusion criteria, documented the methodological quality, assessed risks of bias in the included studies, and extracted data. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We analysed the results as standardised mean differences (SMDs) or mean differences (MDs) for continuous variables, and as odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous variables. Main results We included 62 studies with a total of 1982 participants that compared mirror therapy with other interventions. Of these, 57 were randomised controlled trials and five randomised cross-over trials. Participants had a mean age of 59 years (30 to 73 years). Mirror therapy was provided three to seven times a week, between 15 and 60 minutes for each session for two to eight weeks (on average five times a week, 30 minutes a session for four weeks).When compared with all other interventions, we found moderate-quality evidence that mirror therapy has a significant positive effect on motor function (SMD 0.47, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.67; 1173 participants; 36 studies) and motor impairment (SMD 0.49, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.66; 1292 participants; 39 studies). However, effects on motor function are influenced by the type of control intervention. Additionally, based on moderate-quality evidence, mirror therapy may improve activities of daily living (SMD 0.48, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.65; 622 participants; 19 studies). We found low-quality evidence for a significant positive effect on pain (SMD -0.89, 95% CI -1.67 to -0.11; 248 participants; 6 studies) and no clear effect for improving visuospatial neglect (SMD 1.06, 95% CI -0.10 to 2.23; 175 participants; 5 studies). No adverse effects were reported. Authors' conclusions The results indicate evidence for the effectiveness of mirror therapy for improving upper extremity motor function, motor impairment, activities of daily living, and pain, at least as an adjunct to conventional rehabilitation for people after stroke. Major limitations are small sample sizes and lack of reporting of methodological details, resulting in uncertain evidence quality."
Mixed-Methods Research in Diabetes Management via Mobile Health Technologies: A Scoping Review.	"BACKGROUND: Considering the increasing incidence and prevalence of diabetes worldwide and the high level of patient involvement it requires, diabetes self-management is a serious issue. The use of mobile health (mHealth) in diabetes self-management has increased, but so far research has not provided sufficient information about the uses and effectiveness of mHealth-based interventions. Alternative study designs and more rigorous methodologies are needed. Mixed-methods designs may be particularly useful because both diabetes self-management and mHealth studies require integrating theoretical and methodological approaches. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to examine the extent of the use of mixed-methods research in mHealth-based diabetes management studies. The methodological approaches used to conduct mixed-methods studies were analyzed, and implications for future research are provided. METHODS: Guided by Arksey and O'Malley's framework, this scoping review implemented a comprehensive search strategy including reviewing electronic databases, key journal searches, Web-based research and knowledge centers, websites, and handsearching reference lists of the studies. The studies focusing on mHealth technologies and diabetes management were included in the review if they were primary research papers published in academic journals and reported using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. The key data extracted from the reviewed studies include purpose of mixing, design type, stage of integration, methods of legitimation, and data collection techniques. RESULTS: The final sample (N=14) included studies focused on the feasibility and usability of mHealth diabetes apps (n=7), behavioral measures related to the mHealth apps (n=6), and challenges of intervention delivery in the mHealth context (n=1). Reviewed studies used advanced forms of mixed-methods designs where integration occurred at multiple points and data were collected using multiple techniques. However, the majority of studies did not identify a specific mixed-methods design or use accepted terminology; nor did they justify using this approach. CONCLUSIONS: This review provided important insights into the use of mixed methods in studies focused on diabetes management via mHealth technologies. The prominent role of qualitative methods and tailored measures in diabetes self-management studies was confirmed, and the importance of using multiple techniques and approaches in this field was emphasized. This review suggests defining specific mixed-methods questions, using specific legitimation methods, and developing research designs that overcome sampling and other methodological problems in future studies.

Mobile Apps for Individuals With Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Systematic Review.	"BACKGROUND: Mobile health applications (apps) have the potential to help individuals with chronic illnesses learn about, monitor, and manage their condition, but these apps are largely unexamined, with the state and direction of development unclear. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review of publicly available apps, directed toward individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); described their current features; and determined areas of unmet need. METHODS: We searched the iTunes and Google Play App Stores for the term ""arthritis"" and reviewed the descriptions of these apps for specific mentions of RA. Applications that met inclusion criteria were downloaded and reviewed. Using a set of quality measures identified from literature review, we assessed each app for 4 features: basic characteristics, content source, functionality, and security. Frequencies for each feature were recorded, and percentages were calculated. RESULTS: Twenty apps intended for use by RA patients were identified in December 2016. Fifty percent of apps (n = 10) offered only symptom tracking. Five (20%) provided only information about RA, and 5 (20%) engaged patients by providing both symptom tracking and educational information. Fewer than 50% of apps provided means to contact health care providers or link to an online community, and only 6 (30%) offered security protection for the user. CONCLUSIONS: Most current RA apps do not provide a comprehensive experience for individuals with RA. Areas for optimization include the implementation of smartphone accessibility features and secure methods of protecting individual health information."
Mobile direct observation of therapy (MDOT) - A rapid systematic review and pilot study in children with asthma	"We describe, for the first time, the use of a mobile device platform for remote direct observation of inhaler use and technique. The research programme commenced with a rapid systematic review of mobile device (or videophone) use for direct observation of therapy (MDOT). Ten studies (mainly pilots) were identified involving patients with tuberculosis, sickle cell disease and Alzheimer's disease. New studies are ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov website) in TB, stroke, sickle cell disease, HIV and opioid dependence. Having identified no prior use of MDOT in inhaler monitoring, we implemented a feasibility study in 12 healthy volunteer children (2-12 years; 8 females and 4 males) over a period of 14 days, with twice daily video upload of their 'dummy' inhaler use. Two children uploaded 100% of the requested videos, with only one child having an inhaler upload rate of 0.05), however, mean fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) values normalised (mean 38.7 to 19.3ppm) and mean Asthma Control Test values improved (13.1 to mean 17.8). Feedback from participants was positive. Overall the findings open up a new paradigm in device independent (can be used for any type of inhaler device) monitoring, providing a platform for evaluating / improving inhaler use at home."
Mobile Health Interventions for Improving Health Outcomes in Youth: A Meta-analysis.	"Importance: Mobile health interventions are increasingly popular in pediatrics; however, it is unclear how effective these interventions are in changing health outcomes. Objective: To determine the effectiveness of mobile health interventions for improving health outcomes in youth 18 years or younger. Data Sources: Studies published through November 30, 2016, were collected through PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Educational Resources Information Center, and PsychINFO. Backward and forward literature searches were conducted on articles meeting study inclusion criteria. Search terms included telemedicine, eHealth, mobile health, mHealth, app, and mobile application. Study Selection: Search results were limited to infants, children, adolescents, or young adults when possible. Studies were included if quantitative methods were used to evaluate an application of mobile intervention technology in a primary or secondary capacity to promote or modify health behavior in youth 18 years or younger. Studies were excluded if the article was an unpublished dissertation or thesis, the mean age of participants was older than 18 years, the study did not assess a health behavior and disease outcome, or the article did not include sufficient statistics. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied by 2 independent coders with 20% overlap. Of 9773 unique articles, 36 articles (containing 37 unique studies with a total of 29822 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Of 9773 unique articles, 36 articles (containing 37 unique studies) with a total of 29822 participants met the inclusion criteria. Effect sizes were calculated from statistical tests that could be converted to standardized mean differences. All aggregate effect sizes and moderator variables were tested using random-effects models. Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in health behavior or disease control. Results: A total of 29822 participants were included in the studies. In studies that reported sex, the total number of females was 11226 (53.2%). Of those reporting age, the average was 11.35 years. The random effects aggregate effect size of mobile health interventions was significant (n = 37; Cohen d = 0.22; 95% CI, 0.14-0.29). The random effects model indicated that providing mobile health intervention to a caregiver increased the strength of the intervention effect. Studies that involved caregivers in the intervention produced effect sizes (n = 16; Cohen d = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.18-0.39) larger than those that did not include caregivers (n = 21; Cohen d = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02-0.25). Other coded variables did not moderate study effect size. Conclusions and Relevance: Mobile health interventions appear to be a viable health behavior change intervention modality for youth. Given the ubiquity of mobile phones, mobile health interventions offer promise in improving public health."
Mobile phone messaging for communicating results of medical investigations.	"Background Mobile phone messaging, such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS), has rapidly grown into a mode of communication with a wide range of applications, including communicating the results from medical investigations to patients. Alternative modes of communication of results include face-to-face communication, postal messages, calls to landlines or mobile phones, through web-based health records and email. Possible advantages of mobile phone messaging include convenience to both patients and healthcare providers, reduced waiting times for health services and healthcare costs. Objectives To assess the effects of mobile phone messaging for communicating results of medical investigations, on people's healthcare-seeking behaviour and health outcomes. Secondary objectives include assessment of participants' evaluation of the intervention, direct and indirect healthcare costs and possible risks and harms associated with the intervention. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (January 1993 to June 2009), LILACS (January 1993 to June 2009) and African Health Anthology (January 1993 to June 2009). We also reviewed grey literature (including trial registers) and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, or interrupted time series (ITS) studies with at least three time points before and after the intervention. We included studies assessing mobile phone messaging for communicating results of medical tests, between a healthcare provider or 'treatment buddy' and patient. We only included studies in which it was possible to assess the effects of mobile phone messaging independent of other technologies or interventions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed all studies against the inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations, interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two review authors and confirmed by a third. Primary outcomes of interest were health outcomes and healthcare utilisation as a result of the intervention. We also considered patients' and providers' evaluation of the intervention, perceptions of safety, costs and potential harms or adverse effects of the intervention. Main results We included one randomised controlled trial involving 2782 participants. The study investigated the effects of mobile phone messaging in alleviating anxiety in women waiting for prenatal biochemical screening results for Down syndrome, by providing fast reporting of results before a follow-up appointment. The study measured health outcomes using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), which includes a scale (20 to 80 points, higher score indicates higher anxiety) to describe how the respondent feels at a particular moment in time (state anxiety). The study, which was at high risk of bias, found that women who had received their test result early by text message had a mean anxiety score 2.48 points lower than women who had not yet received their result (95% CI - 8.79 to 3.84). Women with a serum-negative test result receiving their result early had a mean anxiety score 5.3 points lower (95% CI - 5.99 to -4.61) than women in the control group. Women with a serum-positive test result receiving their result early by text message had a mean anxiety score 1.2 points higher (95% CI - 3.48 to 5.88) than women in the control group.The evidence was of low quality due to high risk of bias in the included study, and the fact that the evidence comes from one study only. The study did not report on other outcomes of interest, such as patient satisfaction, adverse events or cost. Authors' conclusions We found very limited evidence of low quality that communicating results of medical investigations by mobile phone messaging may make little or no difference to women's anxiety overall or in women with positive test results, but may reduce anxiety in women with negative test results. However, with only one study included in this review, this evidence is insufficient to inform recommendations at this time. More research is needed on the effectiveness and user evaluation of these interventions. In particular, more research should be conducted into the potential risks and limitations of these interventions."
Mobile phone messaging for facilitating self-management of long-term illnesses	"BACKGROUND: Long-term illnesses affect a significant proportion of the population in developed and developing countries. Mobile phone messaging applications, such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS), may present convenient, cost-effective ways of supporting self-management and improving patients' self-efficacy skills through, for instance, medication reminders, therapy adjustments or supportive messages. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of mobile phone messaging applications designed to facilitate self-management of long-term illnesses, in terms of impact on health outcomes and patients' capacity to self-manage their condition. Secondary objectives include assessment of: user evaluation of the intervention; health service utilisation and costs; and possible risks and harms associated with the intervention. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (January 1993 to June 2009), LILACS (January 1993 to June 2009) and African Health Anthology (January 1993 to June 2009).We also reviewed grey literature (including trial registers) and reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, or interrupted time series (ITS) studies with at least three time points before and after the intervention. We selected only studies where it was possible to assess the effects of mobile phone messaging independent of other technologies or interventions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed all studies against the inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations, interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two review authors and confirmed by a third. Primary outcomes of interest were health outcomes as a result of the intervention and capacity to self-manage long-term conditions. We also considered patients' and providers' evaluation of the intervention, perceptions of safety, health service utilisation and costs, and potential harms or adverse effects. The included studies were heterogeneous in type of condition addressed, intervention characteristics and outcome measures. Therefore, a meta-analysis to derive an overall effect size for the main outcome categories was not considered justified and findings are presented narratively. MAIN RESULTS: We included four randomised controlled trials involving 182 participants.For the primary outcome of health outcomes, including physiological measures, there is moderate quality evidence from two studies involving people with diabetes showing no statistical difference from text messaging interventions compared with usual care or email reminders for glycaemic control (HbA1c), the frequency of diabetic complications, or body weight. There is moderate quality evidence from one study of hypertensive patients that the mean blood pressure and the proportion of patients who achieved blood pressure control were not significantly different in the intervention and control groups, and that there was no statistically significant difference in mean body weight between the groups. There is moderate quality evidence from one study that asthma patients receiving a text messaging intervention experienced greater improvements on peak expiratory flow variability (mean difference (MD) -11.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) -19.56 to -2.68) and the pooled symptom score comprising four items (cough, night symptoms, sleep quality, and maximum tolerated activity) (MD -0.36, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.17) compared with the control group. However, the study found no significant differences between the groups in impact on forced vital capacity or forced expiratory flow in 1 second.For the primary outcome of capacity to self-manage the condition, there is moderate quality evidence from one study that diabetes patients receiving the text messaging intervention demonstrated improved scores on measures of self-management capacity (Self-Efficacy for Diabetes score (MD 6.10, 95% CI 0.45 to 11.75), Diabetes Social Support Interview pooled score (MD 4.39, 95% CI 2.85 to 5.92)), but did not show improved knowledge of diabetes. There is moderate quality evidence from three studies of the effects on treatment compliance. One study showed an increase in hypertensive patients' rates of medication compliance in the intervention group (MD 8.90, 95% CI 0.18 to 17.62) compared with the control group, but in another study there was no statistically significant effect on rates of compliance with peak expiratory flow measurement in asthma patients. Text message prompts for diabetic patients initially also resulted in a higher number of blood glucose results sent back (46.0) than email prompts did (23.5).For the secondary outcome of participants' evaluation of the intervention, there is very low quality evidence from two studies that patients receiving mobile phone messaging support reported perceived improvement in diabetes self-management, wanted to continue receiving messages, and preferred mobile phone messaging to email as a method to access a computerised reminder system.For the secondary outcome of health service utilisation, there is very low quality evidence from two studies. Diabetes patients receiving text messaging support made a comparable number of clinic visits and calls to an emergency hotline as patients without the support. For asthma patients the total number of office visits was higher in the text messaging group, whereas the number of hospital admissions was higher for the control group.Because of the small number of trials included, and the low overall number of participants, for any of the reviewed outcomes the quality of the evidence can at best be considered moderate. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found some, albeit very limited, indications that in certain cases mobile phone messaging interventions may provide benefit in supporting the self-management of long-term illnesses. However, there are significant information gaps regarding the long-term effects, acceptability, costs, and risks of such interventions. Given the enthusiasm with which so-called mHealth interventions are currently being implemented, further research into these issues is needed."
Mobile phone messaging for preventive health care.	"Background Preventive health care promotes health and prevents disease or injuries by addressing factors that lead to the onset of a disease, and by detecting latent conditions to reduce or halt their progression. Many risk factors for costly and disabling conditions (such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases) can be prevented, yet healthcare systems do not make the best use of their available resources to support this process. Mobile phone messaging applications, such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS), could offer a convenient and cost-effective way to support desirable health behaviours for preventive health care. Objectives To assess the effects of mobile phone messaging interventions as a mode of delivery for preventive health care, on health status and health behaviour outcomes. Search methods We searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (January 1993 to June 2009), LILACS (January 1993 to June 2009) and African Health Anthology (January 1993 to June 2009). Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies with at least three time points before and after the intervention. We included studies using SMS or MMS as a mode of delivery for any type of preventive health care. We only included studies in which it was possible to assess the effects of mobile phone messaging independent of other technologies or interventions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed all studies against the inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations, interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two review authors and confirmed by a third author. Primary outcomes of interest were health status and health behaviour outcomes. We also considered patients' and providers' evaluation of the intervention, perceptions of safety, health service utilisation and costs, and potential harms or adverse effects. Because the included studies were heterogeneous in type of condition addressed, intervention characteristics and outcome measures, we did not consider that it was justified to conduct a meta-analysis to derive an overall effect size for the main outcome categories; instead, we present findings narratively. Main results We included four randomised controlled trials involving 1933 participants. Authors' conclusions We found very limited evidence that in certain cases mobile phone messaging interventions may support preventive health care, to improve health status and health behaviour outcomes. However, because of the low number of participants in three of the included studies, combined with study limitations of risk of bias and lack of demonstrated causality, the evidence for these effects is of low to moderate quality. The evidence is of high quality only for interventions aimed at smoking cessation. Furthermore, there are significant information gaps regarding the long-term effects, risks and limitations of, and user satisfaction with, such interventions."
Mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments.	"Background This review is an update of the original Cochrane review published in July 2012. Missed appointments are a major cause of inefficiency in healthcare delivery with substantial monetary costs for the health system, leading to delays in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Patients' forgetfulness is one of the main reasons for missed appointments. Patient reminders may help reduce missed appointments. Modes of communicating reminders for appointments to patients include face-to-face communication, postal messages, calls to landlines or mobile phones, and mobile phone messaging. Mobile phone messaging applications, such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS), could provide an important, inexpensive delivery medium for reminders for healthcare appointments. Objectives To update our review assessing the effects of mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments. Secondary objectives include assessment of costs; health outcomes; patients' and healthcare providers' evaluation of the intervention and perceptions of safety; and possible harms and adverse effects associated with the intervention. Search methods Original searches were run in June 2009. For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to August 2012), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to August 2012), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (January 1993 to August 2012) and CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (January 1993 to August 2012). We also reviewed grey literature (including trial registers) and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing mobile phone messaging as reminders for healthcare appointments. We only included studies in which it was possible to assess effects of mobile phone messaging independent of other technologies or interventions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed all studies against the inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations, interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two review authors and confirmed by a third author. Two authors assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. As the intervention characteristics and outcome measures were similar across included studies, we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate an overall effect size. Main results We included eight randomised controlled trials involving 6615 participants. Four of these studies were newly identified during this update. Authors' conclusions Low to moderate quality evidence included in this review shows that mobile phone text messaging reminders increase attendance at healthcare appointments compared to no reminders, or postal reminders."
Mobile phone text messaging for promoting adherence to antiretroviral therapy in patients with HIV infection.	"Background More than 34 million people are presently living with HIV infection. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can help these people to live longer, healthier lives, but adherence to ART can be difficult. Mobile phone text-messaging has the potential to help promote adherence in these patients. Objectives To determine whether mobile phone text-messaging is efficacious in enhancing adherence to ART in patients with HIV infection. Search methods Using the Cochrane Collaboration's validated search strategies for identifying randomised controlled trials and reports of HIV interventions, along with appropriate keywords and MeSH terms, we searched a range of electronic databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciencias da Saude (LILACS), MEDLINE (via PubMed), PsycINFO, Web of Science, and the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Index Medicus. The date range was from 01 January 1980 to 01 November 2011. There were no limits to language or publication status. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which patients or their caregivers (in the case of infants and children) of any age, in any setting, and receiving ART were provided with mobile phone text messages as a means of promoting adherence to ART. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently examined the abstracts of all identified trials. We initially identified 243 references. Seventeen full-text articles were closely reviewed. Both authors abstracted data independently, using a pre-designed, standardised data collection form. When appropriate, data were combined in meta-analysis. Main results Two RCTs from Kenya were included in the review. One trial compared short weekly text messages against standard care. The other trial compared short daily, long daily, short weekly and long weekly messages against standard care. Both trials were with adult patients. Authors' conclusions There is high-quality evidence from the two RCTs that mobile phone text-messaging at weekly intervals is efficacious in enhancing adherence to ART, compared to standard care. There is high quality evidence from one trial that weekly mobile phone text-messaging is efficacious in improving HIV viral load suppression. Policy-makers should consider funding programs proposing to provide weekly mobile phone text-messaging as a means for promoting adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Clinics and hospitals should consider implementing such programs. There is a need for large RCTs of this intervention in adolescent populations, as well as in high-income countries."
Mobilizing Community Health Workers to Address Mental Health Disparities for Underserved Populations: A Systematic Review.	"This systematic review evaluates efforts to date to involve community health workers (CHWs) in delivering evidence-based mental health interventions to underserved communities in the United States and in low- and middle-income countries. Forty-three articles (39 trials) were reviewed to characterize the background characteristics of CHW, their role in intervention delivery, the types of interventions they delivered, and the implementation supports they received. The majority of trials found that CHW-delivered interventions led to symptom reduction. Training CHWs to support the delivery of evidence-based practices may help to address mental health disparities. Areas for future research as well as clinical and policy implications are discussed."
Models of care in tele-ophthalmology: A scoping review.	"The objective of this review was to identify and describe telehealth models of care for ophthalmic services. We conducted a scoping review of the literature to identify how ophthalmic care can be delivered by telehealth. We searched the PubMed database to identify relevant articles which were screened based on pre-defined inclusion criteria. For included articles, data were extracted, categorised and analysed. Synthesis of findings was performed narratively. The scoping review included 78 articles describing 62 discrete tele-ophthalmic models of care. Tele-ophthalmic models of care can be used for consultative service, screening, triage and remote supervision. The majority of services were for general eye care and triage ( n = 17; 26%) or emergency services ( n = 8; 12%). The most common conditions for disease-specific models of care were diabetic retinopathy ( n = 14; 21%), and glaucoma ( n = 8; 12%). Most models of care involved local clinicians capturing images and transmitting them to an ophthalmologist for assessment. This scoping review demonstrated tele-ophthalmology to be feasible for consultation, screening, triage and remote supervision applications across a broad range of ophthalmic conditions. A large number of models of care have been identified and described in this review. Considerable collaboration between patient-end clinicians and substantial infrastructure is typically required for tele-ophthalmology."
Moderators of Exercise Effects on Depressive Symptoms in Multiple Sclerosis: A Meta-regression	"CONTEXT: This study examined the extent to which patient and trial characteristics moderate the effects of exercise on depressive symptoms among people with multiple sclerosis. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Twenty-four effects were derived from 14 articles published before August 2016 located using Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science. Trials involved 624 people with multiple sclerosis and included both randomization to exercise training or a non-exercise control condition and measurement of depressive symptoms at baseline and at mid- and/or post-intervention. Hedges' d effect sizes were computed, study quality was assessed, and random effects models were used for all analyses. Meta-regression quantified the extent to which patient and trial characteristics moderated the estimated population effect. Analyses were completed in September 2016 and updated in February 2017. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Exercise training significantly reduced depressive symptoms by a heterogeneous mean effect DELTA of 0.55 (95% CI=0.31, 0.78, p<0.001). Significant improvement in fatigue moderated the overall effect (beta=0.37, p<=0.03). Significantly larger antidepressant effects resulted from trials in which exercise significantly improved fatigue (DELTA=1.04, 95% CI=0.53, 1.55, k=8) compared with no significant improvement in fatigue (DELTA=0.41, 95% CI=0.21, 0.60, k=14, z=2.91, p<=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise significantly improves depressive symptoms among people with multiple sclerosis. Exercise-induced improvements in fatigue significantly moderated exercise effects on depressive symptoms. Future trials may benefit from focusing on using exercise to concurrently improve depressive symptoms and fatigue as a symptom cluster. Copyright ¬© 2017 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

Modifiable parenting factors associated with adolescent alcohol misuse: a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies	"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Adolescent alcohol misuse is a growing global health concern. Substantial research suggests that parents have an important role in reducing young people's risk for early initiation of alcohol and alcohol-related harms. To facilitate research translation, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of longitudinal studies examining the range of modifiable parenting factors that are associated with adolescent alcohol initiation and levels of later use/misuse. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO and Embase. Studies were included if they (i) used a longitudinal design; (ii) were published in English; (iii) measured any modifiable parenting factors in adolescence as predictors; (iv) assessed any alcohol-related outcome variables in adolescence and/or alcohol-related problems in adulthood; and (v) had a follow-up interval of at least 1 year. Parental behaviours were categorized into 12 parenting factors. Stouffer's P analyses were used to determine whether the associations between variables were reliable; when there were sufficient studies available, meta-analyses were also conducted to estimate mean effect sizes. RESULTS: Based on 131 studies, three risk factors (parental provision of alcohol, favourable parental attitudes towards alcohol use and parental drinking) and four protective factors (parental monitoring, parent-child relationship quality, parental support and parental involvement) were identified as longitudinal predictors of both alcohol initiation and levels of later alcohol use/misuse, based on their significant results in both Stouffer's P analyses and meta-analyses. The mean effect sizes were mainly small (rs = -0.224 to 0.263). CONCLUSIONS: Risk of adolescent alcohol misuse is positively associated with parental provision of alcohol, favourable parental attitudes towards alcohol use and parental drinking. It is negatively associated with parental monitoring, parent-child relationship quality, parental support and parental involvement. Copyright ¬© 2017 Society for the Study of Addiction."
Modifiable Psychosocial Constructs Associated With Physical Activity Participation in People With Multiple Sclerosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	"OBJECTIVE: To synthesize current knowledge of the modifiable psychosocial constructs associated with physical activity (PA) participation in people with multiple sclerosis. DATA SOURCES: A search was conducted through October 2015 in 8 electronic databases: CINAHL, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Web of Knowledge, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and PsycINFO. STUDY SELECTION: Cohort and intervention studies were included if they (1) included an objective or subjective measure of PA; (2) measured at least 1 modifiable psychosocial construct; and (3) reported bivariate correlations (or these could be extracted) between the PA and psychosocial construct measures. A total of 13,867 articles were screened for inclusion, and 26 were included in the final analysis. DATA EXTRACTION: Meta-analyses of correlations were conducted using the Hedges-Olkin method. Where a meta-analysis was not possible, results were reported descriptively. DATA SYNTHESIS: Meta-analyses indicated a pooled correlation coefficient between (1) objective PA and self-efficacy (n=7) of r=.30 (P<.0001), indicating a moderate, positive association; (2) subjective PA and self-efficacy (n=7) of r=.34 (P<.0001), indicating a moderate, positive association; (3) subjective PA and goal-setting (n=5) of r=.44 (P<.0001), indicating a moderate-to-large positive association; and 4) subjective PA and outcome expectancies (n=4) (physical: r=.13, P=.11; social: r=.19, P<.0001; self-evaluative: r=.27, P<.0001), indicating small-moderate positive associations. Other constructs such as measures of health beliefs, enjoyment, social support, and perceived benefits and barriers were reported to be significantly correlated with PA in individual studies, but the number of studies was not sufficient for a meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Future PA interventions should continue to focus on the psychosocial constructs of self-efficacy and goal-setting. However, there is a need to explore the associations between other constructs outside those reported in this review. Copyright ¬© 2016 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.

More than Data Collectors: A Systematic Review of the Environmental Outcomes of Youth Inquiry Approaches in the United States	"Over the last twenty years, research on the impact of engaging children and adolescents in the generation of new knowledge about their lives, schools, and communities, has grown tremendously. This systematic review summarizes the findings from empirical studies of youth inquiry approaches in the United States, with a focus on their environmental outcomes. Searches of four interdisciplinary databases retrieved a total of 3,724 relevant articles published between 1995 and 2015. Sixty-three distinct studies met the systematic review inclusion criteria, of which, 36 (57.1%) reported that the youth inquiry approach contributed to positive changes among adults, peers, organizations, and/or institutions. These environmental outcomes were qualitatively recorded, inductively categorized, and then organized into Bronfenbrenner's ecological framework. Youth inquiry approaches led to practitioner growth and changes in peer group norms at the micro-system level, program development or improvement and research benefits at the meso-system level, and school, city, and state level policy adoption at the exo-system level. Qualitative methods, especially case studies, were most commonly used to evaluate the impact of youth inquiry approaches on environmental outcomes. Studies of approaches that utilized advocacy to create change, targeted decision-makers as the audience for the youth's work and convened for a longer duration were more likely to report improved environmental outcomes. This systematic review suggests that youth inquiry approaches are a promising strategy for ecological systems change. Highlights: Environmental outcomes reported in 36 US studies of youth inquiry approaches.Outcomes included changes to practitioners, policies, programs, research, and peer group norms.Long term, advocacy-oriented groups targeting decision-makers were more likely to report outcomes."
Most response-inducing strategies do not increase participation in observational studies: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	"Objectives: To evaluate response-inducing strategies for observational studies using health-related questionnaires or interviews. Study Design and Setting: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science up to December 28, 2017. Studies evaluating the effect of a response-inducing strategy on participation rates of observational studies were included. For each strategy, we estimated pooled response ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in a Hartung-Knapp/Sidik-Jonkman random effects model with the final participation rate as outcome, stratified for type of participants and method of data collection. Results: The search yielded 168 eligible studies involving 367,616 potential participants and 33 strategies. Among patients, response-inducing strategies for paper-based questionnaires included unconditional monetary incentives (response ratio 1.15; 95% CI 1.09-1.21) and shorter questionnaires (1.04; 1.02-1.06). Among nonpatients, a personalized mode of delivery (1.47; 1.24-1.74), more expensive mailing type (1.25; 1.00-1.56), unconditional monetary incentives (1.24; 1.12-1.38), prenotification (1.12; 1.03-1.22), unconditional scratch lottery tickets (1.09; 1.01-1.18), and shorter questionnaires (1.06; 1.02-1.11) increased response rates to paper-based questionnaires. For Web-based questionnaires and interviews among nonpatients, response rates were increased by conditional lottery tickets (1.17; 1.02-1.34) and conditional monetary incentives (1.39; 1.01-1.91), respectively. Conclusion: Although the majority of strategies evaluated were unsuccessful, some may increase response rates to observational studies, particularly among nonpatients."
Mothers' and health visitors' perceptions of the support provided to mothers who have experienced domestic violence: A systematic review.	"BACKGROUND: Domestic violence has been described as a public health epidemic, with victims of domestic violence encountered in all health care settings. Within the United Kingdom the role of the health visitor (specialist community public health nurse) is to promote health in the whole community; every family with a child under five years has a named health visitor. Preparation for the health visitor role is unique to the United Kingdom. Health visitors are particularly well placed to identify and support mothers who are experiencing domestic violence. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to synthesise the best available evidence relating to support provided by UK health visitors for mothers who have experienced domestic violence, from both the mothers and the health visitors' perspectives. INCLUSION CRITERIA: The participants of interest were mothers who have experienced domestic violence and health visitors who offer support to those mothers.The self reported experiences of health visitor support provided to mothers who have experienced domestic violence, from the perspective of both the mothers and the health visitors providing the support.This review considered studies that focus on qualitative data including, but not limited to, designs such as ethnography, phenomenology, grounded theory, action research and feminist research. SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies published up to April 2011 were included in the review. The search was restricted to English language studies. The databases searched were: Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, EMBASE, British Nursing Index and Archive, ASSIA and TRIP. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Studies were assessed for methodological quality using the standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted using standardised data extraction tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data synthesis used the Joanna Briggs Institute approach for meta-synthesis by meta-aggregation. Findings were synthesised into categories, which were aggregated into synthesised findings. RESULTS: Four qualitative papers were included in this review. Forty-five findings were synthesised into eighteen categories, from which six synthesised findings were derived which answered the review objectives. CONCLUSIONS: Mothers who have experienced domestic violence were reluctant to disclose this to health visitors; those who did disclose felt unsupported. Health visitors perceive domestic violence differently and their knowledge of strategies to deal with mothers experiencing domestic violence is limited. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Health visitors require appropriate training to enable them to recognise and discuss domestic violence, respond appropriately where they identify that mothers are experiencing domestic violence and provide support and guidance including information about, and appropriate referral to, support agencies. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Further research should determine what type of continuing training and support is effective for health visitors in identifying and supporting mothers who are experiencing domestic violence."
Motivating factors and barriers towards exercise in severe mental illness: A systematic review and meta-analysis	"Exercise can improve clinical outcomes in people with severe mental illness (SMI). However, this population typically engages in low levels of physical activity with poor adherence to exercise interventions. Understanding the motivating factors and barriers towards exercise for people with SMI would help to maximize exercise participation. A search of major electronic databases was conducted from inception until May 2016. Quantitative studies providing proportional data on the motivating factors and/or barriers towards exercise among patients with SMI were eligible. Random-effects meta-analyses were undertaken to calculate proportional data and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for motivating factors and barriers toward exercise. From 1468 studies, 12 independent studies of 6431 psychiatric patients were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analyses showed that 91% of people with SMI endorsed Äòimproving health"" as a reason for exercise (N = 6, n = 790, 95% CI 80Äì94). Among specific aspects of health and well-being, the most common motivations were Äòlosing weight"" (83% of patients), Äòimproving mood"" (81%) and Äòreducing stress"" (78%). However, low mood and stress were also identified as the most prevalent barriers towards exercise (61% of patients), followed by Äòlack of support"" (50%). Many of the desirable outcomes of exercise for people with SMI, such as mood improvement, stress reduction and increased energy, are inversely related to the barriers of depression, stress and fatigue which frequently restrict their participation in exercise. Providing patients with professional support to identify and achieve their exercise goals may enable them to overcome psychological barriers, and maintain motivation towards regular physical activity.

Motivation for physical activity and exercise in severe mental illness: A systematic review of intervention studies	"There has been increasing interest for research on motivation for physical activity (PA) and exercise among individuals with severe mental illness (SMI). The aim of this systematic review is to summarize findings from all intervention studies on PA or exercise that either include empirical data on motivational constructs or apply motivational techniques/theories in their intervention. Systematic searches of seven databases were conducted from database inception to February 2015. Studies were eligible if they: (i) included participants with SMI, (ii) had PA as part of the intervention, and (iii) reported empirical data on motivational constructs related to PA or incorporated motivational techniques/theory in their intervention. Of the 79 studies that met the inclusion criteria only one had motivation for PA as its main outcome. Nine additional interventions reported empirical data on motivational constructs. Altogether these studies yielded mixed results with respect to change in motivational constructs. Only one of those examined the association between motivation and PA, but found none. Sixty-four studies reported using motivational techniques/theory in their intervention. Motivational interviewing and goal-setting were the most popular techniques. Due to the exploratory nature of most of these studies, findings from intervention studies do not so far give very clear directions for motivational work with the patients. There is an urgent need for a more systematic theory based approach when developing strategies that target to increase engagement in PA among people with SMI.

Motivational Interviewing for Parent-child Health Interventions: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	"PURPOSE: Motivational interviewing (MI) is a patient-centered approach focusing on building intrinsic motivation for change. This paper presents a meta-analysis of parent-involved MI to improve pediatric health behavior and health outcomes. METHODS: Study inclusion criteria: (1) examined modifiable pediatric health behaviors (< 18 years old); (2) used MI or motivational enhancement; (3) conducted a randomized controlled trial with a comparison group (non-MI control or active treatment group); (4) conducted the intervention with only a parent or both a parent and child; and (5) were written in English. Twenty-five studies (with 5,130 participants) were included and independently rated. Weighted mean effect sizes, using random-effects assumptions, were calculated. RESULTS: Relative to comparison groups, MI was associated with significant improvements in health behaviors (e.g., oral health, diet, physical activity, reduced screen time, smoking cessation, reduced second hand smoke) and reduction in body mass index. Results suggest that MI may also outperform comparison groups in terms of dental caries, but more studies are needed. MI interventions were more successful at improving diets for Caucasians and when the intervention included more MI components. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide support for providing motivational interviewing to parents and children to improve pediatric health behaviors."
Motivational interviewing for the prevention of alcohol misuse in young adults.	"Background Alcohol use and misuse in young people is a major risk behaviour for mortality and morbidity. Motivational interviewing (MI) is a popular technique for addressing excessive drinking in young adults. Objectives To assess the effects of motivational interviewing (MI) interventions for preventing alcohol misuse and alcohol-related problems in young adults. Search methods We identified relevant evidence from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 12), MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2015), EMBASE (January 1988 to July 2015), and PsycINFO (1985 to July 2015). We also searched clinical trial registers and handsearched references of topic-related systematic reviews and the included studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials in young adults up to the age of 25 years comparing MIs for prevention of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related problems with no intervention, assessment only or alternative interventions for preventing alcohol misuse and alcohol-related problems. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included a total of 84 trials (22,872 participants), with 70/84 studies reporting interventions in higher risk individuals or settings. Studies with follow-up periods of at least four months were of more interest in assessing the sustainability of intervention effects and were also less susceptible to short-term reporting or publication bias. Overall, the risk of bias assessment showed that these studies provided moderate or low quality evidence. Authors' conclusions The results of this review indicate that there are no substantive, meaningful benefits of MI interventions for preventing alcohol use, misuse or alcohol-related problems. Although we found some statistically significant effects, the effect sizes were too small, given the measurement scales used in the included studies, to be of relevance to policy or practice. Moreover, the statistically significant effects are not consistent for all misuse measures, and the quality of evidence is not strong, implying that any effects could be inflated by risk of bias."
Motivational Interviewing Improves Medication Adherence: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis	"BACKGROUND: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs), mostly conducted among minority populations, have reported that motivational interviewing (MI) can improve medication adherence. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of MI and of the MI delivery format, fidelity assessment, fidelity-based feedback, counselors' background and MI exposure time on adherence. DATA SOURCES: We searched the MEDLINE database for studies published from 1966 until February 2015. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included RCTs that compared MI to a control group and reported a numerical measure of medication adherence. DATA SYNTHESIS: The main outcome was medication adherence defined as any subjective or objective measure reported as the proportion of subjects with adequate adherence or mean adherence and standard deviation. For categorical variables we calculated the relative risk (RR) of medication adherence, and for continuous variables we calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) between the MI and control groups. RESULTS: We included 17 RCTs. Ten targeted adherence to HAART. For studies reporting a categorical measure (n = 11), the pooled RR for medication adherence was higher for MI compared with control (1.17; 95 % CI 1.05- 1.31; p < 0.01). For studies reporting a continuous measure (n = 11), the pooled SMD for medication adherence was positive (0.70; 95 % CI 0.15-1.25; p < 0.01) for MI compared with control. The characteristics that were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with medication adherence were telephonic MI and fidelity-based feedback among studies reporting categorical measures, group MI and fidelity assessment among studies reporting continuous measures and delivery by nurses or research assistants. Effect sizes differed in magnitude, creating high heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: MI improves medication adherence at different exposure times and counselors' educational level. However, the evaluation of MI characteristics associated with success had inconsistent results. Larger studies targeting diverse populations with a variety of chronic conditions are needed to clarify the effect of different MI delivery modes, fidelity assessment and provision of fidelity based-feedback."
Motivations for having children after cancerÄîA systematic review of the literature	"Over the last decade, fertility-related issues have come to the fore of clinical oncology. The majority of research though has focused on a medical perspective without considering reproductive motivations that influence decisions on fertility-preserving options. In order to identify specific parenthood motivations in young survivors of various types of cancer, a systematic review of the literature was conducted. Relevant literature was searched manually and using databases (Medline/PubMed, PsycInfo). Of 4848 articles retrieved, 20 studies met a priori defined inclusion criteria. Cancer was found to have a likely effect on reproductive intentions. All studies reported on specific reproductive concerns, mostly related to negative consequences for the patient or on the future child. Pregnancy concerns were overrepresented in breast cancer survivors. Practical barriers to post-cancer parenthood were financial or partner-referred. Overall, fewer incentives than disincentives for post-cancer parenthood were reported. They included the importance of parenthood, achieving normality and a desire to focus on the positive. As reproductive motivations and concerns affect the majority of cancer survivors of reproductive age, they should be assessed as early as possible post-diagnosis. While researchers should focus on the development of appropriate assessment methods, clinicians might address specific reproductive concerns.

Motivations of children and their parents to participate in drug research: a systematic review	"UNLABELLED: Information on motivations for research participation, may enable professionals to better tailor the process of recruitment and informed consent to the perspective of parents and children. Therefore, this systematic review assesses motivating and discouraging factors for children and their parents to decide to participate in clinical drug research. Studies were identified from searches in 6 databases. Two independent reviewers screened and selected relevant articles. Results were aggregated and presented by use of qualitative metasummary. 38 studies fulfilled the selection criteria and were of sufficient quality for inclusion in the qualitative metasummary. Most mentioned motivating factors for parents were: health benefit for child, altruism, trust in research, and relation to researcher. Most mentioned motivating factors for children were: personal health benefit, altruism and increasing comfort. Fear of risks, distrust in research, logistical aspects and disruption of daily life were mentioned most by parents as discouraging factors. Burden and disruption of daily life, feeling like a ""guinea pig"" and fear of risks were most mentioned as discouraging factors by children. CONCLUSION: Paying attention to these motivating and discouraging factors of children and their parents during the recruitment and informed consent process in drug research increases the moral and instrumental value of informed consent. WHAT IS KNOWN: * This systematic review pools the existing empirical literature on motivations of minors and their parents to consent or dissent to participation in clinical drug research. * The most mentioned motivating and discouraging factors for children and their parents to consent to participation in clinical drug research are identified aggregated and presented by use of qualitative metasummary. What is new: * This information can be used to adapt the research protocol, recruitment, and informed consent/assent process to the needs of children and their parents."
Motivators and Barriers for Older People Participating in Resistance Training: A Systematic Review	"Regular participation in resistance training is important for older people to maintain their health and independence, yet participation rates are low. The study aimed to identify motivators and barriers to older people participating in resistance training. A systematic review was conducted including quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method studies. Searches generated 15,920 citations from six databases, with 14 studies (n = 1,937 participants) included. In total, 92 motivators and 24 barriers were identified. Motivators specific to participating in resistance training included preventing deterioration (disability), reducing risk of falls, building (toning) muscles, feeling more alert, and better concentration. Looking too muscular and thinking participation increased the risk of having a heart attack, stroke, or death, despite the minimal likelihood of these occurring, were barriers. The analysis indicates that increasing participation in resistance training among older people should focus on the specific benefits valued by older people and the dissemination of accurate information to counter misperceptions."
Motivators and barriers for physical activity in the oldest old: a systematic review	"Worldwide, people engage insufficiently in physical activity, particularly subjects aged 80 years and over. For optimal life-style campaigns, knowledge of motivators and barriers for physical activity is mandatory. Given their specific needs, it is conceivable that these would be different for the oldest old compared to younger subjects. Pubmed, Web of Science and Psychinfo were systematically screened for articles reporting motivators and barriers for physical activity. Papers were excluded if data regarding elderly aged >79 years were absent. Forty-four relevant articles were included, involving a total of 28,583 subjects. Sixty one motivators and 59 barriers for physical activity in the elderly were identified, including those who are relevant for persons aged 80 years and over. Based on the results of our literature review, we recommend that when promoting physical activity in the oldest old, special attention is paid to the health benefits of physical activity, to the subject's fears, individual preferences and social support, and to constraints related to the physical environment. However, no studies were found exclusively describing people aged 80 years and over, and future research is necessary to differentiate the barriers or motivators that are specific for the oldest old from those of younger elderly.

Motor Rehabilitation Using Kinect: A Systematic Review	"BACKGROUND: Interactive systems are being developed with the intention to help in the engagement of patients on various therapies. Amid the recent technological advances, KinectTM from Microsoft (Redmond, WA) has helped pave the way on how user interaction technology facilitates and complements many clinical applications. In order to examine the actual status of Kinect developments for rehabilitation, this article presents a systematic review of articles that involve interactive, evaluative, and technical advances related to motor rehabilitation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Systematic research was performed in the IEEE Xplore and PubMed databases using the key word combination ""Kinect AND rehabilitation"" with the following inclusion criteria: (1) English language, (2) page number >4, (3) Kinect system for assistive interaction or clinical evaluation, or (4) Kinect system for improvement or evaluation of the sensor tracking or movement recognition. Quality assessment was performed by QualSyst standards. RESULTS: In total, 109 articles were found in the database research, from which 31 were included in the review: 13 were focused on the development of assistive systems for rehabilitation, 3 in evaluation, 3 in the applicability category, 7 on validation of Kinect anatomic and clinical evaluation, and 5 on improvement techniques. Quality analysis of all included articles is also presented with their respective QualSyst checklist scores. CONCLUSIONS: Research and development possibilities and future works with the Kinect for rehabilitation application are extensive. Methodological improvements when performing studies on this area need to be further investigated."
Motor skills intervention research of children with disabilities	"Background: Physical inactivity and obesity among children with physical and cognitive disabilities is an emerging public health issue. Children's motor skill development is a determinant of lifelong physical activity and obesity.Aims: The purpose of this article is to critically evaluate motor skill intervention literature among children with physical and cognitive disabilities.Methods and Procedures: Electronic searches were completed to identity research articles published from 1984 to 2014. Major findings were categorized among subtopics including characteristics of intervention studies, research designs, diagnostic method, motor skill interventions and motor skill outcome.Outcomes and Results: 21 studies were found and included participants with developmental delay (42.8%), autism (19.0%), cross-disability (19.0%), intellectual disability (4.8%), cerebral palsy (4.8%), developmental coordination disorder (4.8%), and learning disabilities (4.8%). Only one study was a randomized controlled trial.Conclusions: and implications: The current literature on motor skill intervention research is broad in scope and has limited generalizability within and across disability groups.

Motor vehicle crashes among Canadian Aboriginal people: a review of the literature	"INTRODUCTION: Aboriginal people are substantially more likely to be injured or die in motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) than the general population. However, research examining MVCs among Canadian Aboriginal populations is limited. We examine trends and gaps in the Canadian literature and suggest priorities for future research. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the published and grey literature on MVCs involving Canadian Aboriginal people. We used the Haddon matrix of injury epidemiology and prevention to identify trends in crash-related risk factors. RESULTS: We reviewed 20 studies, which consisted of research at both national and provincial levels. We identified various risk factors related to human (e.g., male sex, substance use), vehicle and equipment (e.g., driving an older vehicle, driving a car v. other types of vehicles]), and physical environment (e.g., occurring on-reserve, muddy and loose-gravel road conditions) variables. However, we did not find research that examined risk factors related to the social environment, such as perspectives related to MVCs. CONCLUSION: This review indicates that rates of death, hospital admission and injury related to MVCs are twice as high among Aboriginal populations than the general Canadian population, which highlights a major public health concern. Priorities for future research should include examination of the social environment, more rigorous methods and collaborative research in partnership with Aboriginal communities."
Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) Models in Health Technology Assessment of Orphan Drugs-a Systematic Literature Review. Next Steps in Methodology Development?.	"Background: Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a decision-making tool that can take into account multidimensional factors and enables comparison of (medical) technologies by combining individual criteria into one overall appraisal. The MCDA approach has slowly gained traction within Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and its elements are gradually being incorporated into HTA across Europe. Several groups of scientists have proposed MCDA approaches targeted toward orphan drugs and rare diseases by including criteria specific to rare diseases. The goal of this article is to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge and latest developments in the field of MCDA in HTA for orphan drugs, to review existing models, their design characteristics, as well as to identify opportunities for further model improvement. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in January 2018 using four databases: MEDLINE (Pubmed), EBSCO HOST, EMBASE, and Web of science to find publications related to use of MCDA in the rare disease field (keywords: MCDA/orphan drug/rare disease and synonyms). Identified MCDA models were analyzed, e.g., structure, criteria, scoring, and weighting methodology. Results: Two hundred and eleven publications were identified, of which 29 were included after removal of duplicates. 9 authors developed own MCDA models, 7 of which based on literature reviews intended to identify the most important and relevant decision criteria in the model. In 13 publications (8 models) weights were assigned to criteria based on stakeholder input. The most commonly chosen criteria for creation of the MCDA models were: comparative effectiveness/efficacy, the need for intervention, and disease severity. Some models have overlapping criteria, especially in the treatment cost and effectiveness areas. Conclusions: A range of MCDA models for HTA have been developed, each with a slightly different approach, focus, and complexity, including several that specifically target rare diseases and orphan drug appraisal. Models have slowly progressed over the years based on pilots, stakeholder input, sharing experiences and scientific publications. However, full consensus on model structure, criteria selection and weighting is still lacking. A simplification of the MCDA model approach may increase its acceptance. A multi-stakeholder discussion on fundamental design and implementation strategies for MCDA models would be beneficial to this end."
Multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation for chronic low back pain	"BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is responsible for considerable personal suffering worldwide. Those with persistent disabling symptoms also contribute to substantial costs to society via healthcare expenditure and reduced work productivity. While there are many treatment options, none are universally endorsed. The idea that chronic LBP is a condition best understood with reference to an interaction of physical, psychological and social influences, the 'biopsychosocial model', has received increasing acceptance. This has led to the development of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) programs that target factors from the different domains, administered by healthcare professionals from different backgrounds. OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence on the effectiveness of MBR for patients with chronic LBP. The focus was on comparisons with usual care and with physical treatments measuring outcomes of pain, disability and work status, particularly in the long term. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases in January and March 2014 together with carrying out handsearches of the reference lists of included and related studies, forward citation tracking of included studies and screening of studies excluded in the previous version of this review. SELECTION CRITERIA: All studies identified in the searches were screened independently by two review authors; disagreements regarding inclusion were resolved by consensus. The inclusion criteria were published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included adults with non-specific LBP of longer than 12 weeks duration; the index intervention targeted at least two of physical, psychological and social or work-related factors; and the index intervention was delivered by clinicians from at least two different professional backgrounds. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors extracted and checked information to describe the included studies, assessed risk of bias and performed the analyses. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to describe the methodological quality. The primary outcomes were pain, disability and work status, divided into the short, medium and long term. Secondary outcomes were psychological functioning (for example depression, anxiety, catastrophising), healthcare service utilisation, quality of life and adverse events. We categorised the control interventions as usual care, physical treatment, surgery, or wait list for surgery in separate meta-analyses. The first two comparisons formed our primary focus. We performed meta-analyses using random-effects models and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE method. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of the methodological quality, and subgroup analyses to investigate the influence of baseline symptom severity and intervention intensity. MAIN RESULTS: From 6168 studies identified in the searches, 41 RCTs with a total of 6858 participants were included. Methodological quality ratings ranged from 1 to 9 out 12, and 13 of the 41 included studies were assessed as low risk of bias. Pooled estimates from 16 RCTs provided moderate to low quality evidence that MBR is more effective than usual care in reducing pain and disability, with standardised mean differences (SMDs) in the long term of 0.21 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.37) and 0.23 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.4) respectively. The range across all time points equated to approximately 0.5 to 1.4 units on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale for pain and 1.4 to 2.5 points on the Roland Morris disability scale (0 to 24). There was moderate to low quality evidence of no difference on work outcomes (odds ratio (OR) at long term 1.04, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.47). Pooled estimates from 19 RCTs provided moderate to low quality evidence that MBR was more effective than physical treatment for pain and disability with SMDs in the long term of 0.51 (95% CI -0.01 to 1.04) and 0.68 (95% CI 0.16 to 1.19) respectively. Across all time points this translated to approximately 0.6 to 1.2 units on the pain scale and 1.2 to 4.0 points on the Roland Morris scale. There was moderate to low quality evidence of an effect on work outcomes (OR at long term 1.87, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.53). There was insufficient evidence to assess whether MBR interventions were associated with more adverse events than usual care or physical interventions.Sensitivity analyses did not suggest that the pooled estimates were unduly influenced by the results from low quality studies. Subgroup analyses were inconclusive regarding the influence of baseline symptom severity and intervention intensity. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic LBP receiving MBR are likely to experience less pain and disability than those receiving usual care or a physical treatment. MBR also has a positive influence on work status compared to physical treatment. Effects are of a modest magnitude and should be balanced against the time and resource requirements of MBR programs. More intensive interventions were not responsible for effects that were substantially different to those of less intensive interventions. While we were not able to determine if symptom intensity at presentation influenced the likelihood of success, it seems appropriate that only those people with indicators of significant psychosocial impact are referred to MBR."
Multidisciplinary Clinics in Lung Cancer Care: A Systematic Review.	"Multidisciplinary cancer clinics (MDCCs) are recognized in cancer care as an alternate model of care for lung cancer patients. However, the precise MDCC characteristics that could potentially improve the quality of care in lung cancer care have not been clearly defined. We performed a systematic review of the data regarding MDCCs in the treatment of patients with lung cancer to summarize and evaluate the available evidence and to determine valuable clinic characteristics and projected outcomes. We searched Embase, Cochrane, Medline, PubMed, and Web of Science through April 2017 for studies that included >= 2 physician specialties in a MDCC for lung cancer. A total of 2374 unique articles were identified, of which 13 met the inclusion criteria. All the studies were either retrospective or qualitative, with many having small sample sizes. The most commonly reported quantitative outcome for MDCCs was a decreased time from diagnosis to treatment; however, this was only statistically significant in 2 studies. Evidence was conflicting regarding improved patient survival. Several studies of MDCCs reported improved qualitative outcomes, including increased patient satisfaction, increased collaboration, and cohesive communication among care providers, although the sample sizes were small. The few studies of MDCCs that included a care coordinator, in addition to physicians from multiple specialties, reported improvements in patient satisfaction. Overall, our review of the reported data revealed a paucity of evidence regarding the value of MDCCs for lung cancer patients, highlighting the need for further studies to understand the optimal medical model to deliver care.

Multifactorial and multiple component interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community.	"Background Falls and fall-related injuries are common, particularly in those aged over 65, with around one-third of older people living in the community falling at least once a year. Falls prevention interventions may comprise single component interventions (e.g. exercise), or involve combinations of two or more different types of intervention (e.g. exercise and medication review). Their delivery can broadly be divided into two main groups: 1) multifactorial interventions where component interventions differ based on individual assessment of risk; or 2) multiple component interventions where the same component interventions are provided to all people. Objectives To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of multifactorial interventions and multiple component interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, trial registers and reference lists. Date of search: 12 June 2017. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials, individual or cluster, that evaluated the effects of multifactorial and multiple component interventions on falls in older people living in the community, compared with control (i.e. usual care (no change in usual activities) or attention control (social visits)) or exercise as a single intervention. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risks of bias and extracted data. We calculated the rate ratio (RaR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for rate of falls. For dichotomous outcomes we used risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs. For continuous outcomes, we used the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs. We pooled data using the random-effects model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results We included 62 trials involving 19,935 older people living in the community. The median trial size was 248 participants. Most trials included more women than men. The mean ages in trials ranged from 62 to 85 years (median 77 years). Most trials (43 trials) reported follow-up of 12 months or over. We assessed most trials at unclear or high risk of bias in one or more domains. Authors' conclusions Multifactorial interventions may reduce the rate of falls compared with usual care or attention control. However, there may be little or no effect on other fall-related outcomes. Multiple component interventions, usually including exercise, may reduce the rate of falls and risk of falling compared with usual care or attention control."
Multimedia educational interventions for consumers about prescribed and over-the-counter medications	"Health consumers increasingly want access to accurate, evidence-based information about their medications. Currently, education about medications (that is, information that is designed to achieve health or illness related learning) is provided predominantly via spoken communication between the health provider and consumer, sometimes supplemented with written materials. There is evidence, however, that current educational methods are not meeting consumer needs. Multimedia educational programs offer many potential advantages over traditional forms of education delivery. To assess the effects of multimedia patient education interventions about prescribed and over-the-counter medications in people of all ages, including children and carers. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to June 2011), EMBASE (1974 to June 2011), CINAHL (1982 to June 2011), PsycINFO (1967 to June 2011), ERIC (1966 to June 2011), ProQuest Dissertation & Theses Database (to June 2011) and reference lists of articles. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of multimedia-based patient education about prescribed or over-the-counter medications in people of all ages, including children and carers, if the intervention had been targeted for their use. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Where possible, we contacted study authors to obtain missing information. We identified 24 studies that enrolled a total of 8112 participants. However, there was significant heterogeneity in the comparators used and the outcomes measured, which limited the ability to pool data. Many of the studies did not report sufficient information in their methods to allow judgment of their risk of bias. From the information that was reported, three of the studies had a high risk of selection bias and one was at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding of the outcome assessors. None of the included studies reported the minimum clinically important difference for the outcomes that were measured. We have therefore reported results from the studies but have been unable to interpret whether differences were of clinical importance.The main findings of the review are as follows.Knowledge: There is low quality evidence that multimedia education was more effective than usual care (non-standardised education provided as part of usual clinical care) or no education (standardised mean difference (SMD) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.58, six studies with 817 participants). There was considerable statistical heterogeneity (I(2) = 89%), however, all but one of the studies favoured the multimedia group. There is moderate quality evidence that multimedia education was not more effective at improving knowledge than control multimedia interventions (i.e. multimedia programs that do not provide information about the medication) (mean difference (MD) of knowledge scores 2.78%, 95% CI -1.48 to 7.0, two studies with 568 participants). There is moderate quality evidence that multimedia education was more effective when added to a co-intervention (written information or brief standardised instructions provided by a health professional) compared with the co-intervention alone (MD of knowledge scores 24.59%, 95% CI 22.34 to 26.83, two studies with 381 participants).Skill acquisition: There is moderate quality evidence that multimedia education was more effective than usual care or no education (MD of inhaler technique score 18.32%, 95% CI 11.92 to 24.73, two studies with 94 participants) and written education (risk ratio (RR) of improved inhaler technique 2.14, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.44, two studies with 164 participants). There is very low quality evidence that multimedia education was equally effective as education by a health professional (MD of inhaler technique score -1.01%, 95% CI -15.75 to 13.72, three studies with 130 participants).Compliance with medications: There is moderate quality evidence that there was no difference between multimedia education and usual care or no education (RR of complying 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08, two studies with 4552 participants).We could not determine the effect of multimedia education on other outcomes, including patient satisfaction, self-efficacy and health outcomes, due to an inadequate number of studies from which to draw conclusions. This review provides evidence that multimedia education about medications is more effective than usual care (non-standardised education provided by health professionals as part of usual clinical care) or no education, in improving both knowledge and skill acquisition. It also suggests that multimedia education is at least equivalent to other forms of education, including written education and education provided by a health professional. However, this finding is based on often low quality evidence from a small number of trials. Multimedia education about medications could therefore be considered as an adjunct to usual care but there is inadequate evidence to recommend it as a replacement for written education or education by a health professional. Multimedia education may be considered as an alternative to education provided by a health professional, particularly in settings where provision of detailed education by a health professional is not feasible. More studies evaluating multimedia educational interventions are required in order to increase confidence in the estimate of effect of the intervention.Conclusions regarding the effect of multimedia education were limited by the lack of information provided by study authors about the educational interventions, and variability in their content and quality. Studies testing educational interventions should provide detailed information about the interventions and comparators. Research is required to establish a framework that is specific for the evaluation of the quality of multimedia educational programs. Conclusions were also limited by the heterogeneity in the outcomes reported and the instruments used to measure them. Research is required to identify a core set of outcomes which should be measured when evaluating patient educational interventions. Future research should use consistent, reliable and validated outcome measures so that comparisons can be made between studies.CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]"
Music therapy for depression.	"Background Depression is a highly prevalent mood disorder that is characterised by persistent low mood, diminished interest, and loss of pleasure. Music therapy may be helpful in modulating moods and emotions. An update of the 2008 Cochrane review was needed to improve knowledge on effects of music therapy for depression. Objectives 1. To assess effects of music therapy for depression in people of any age compared with treatment as usual (TAU) and psychological, pharmacological, and/or other therapies. Search methods We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMD-CTR; from inception to 6 May 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; to 17 June 2016); Thomson Reuters/Web of Science (to 21 June 2016); Ebsco/PsycInfo, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, and PubMed (to 5 July 2016); the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, the National Guideline Clearing House, and OpenGrey (to 6 September 2016); and the Digital Access to Research Theses (DART)-Europe E-theses Portal, Open Access Theses and Dissertations, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Database (to 7 September 2016). We checked reference lists of retrieved articles and relevant systematic reviews and contacted trialists and subject experts for additional information when needed. We updated this search in August 2017 and placed potentially relevant studies in the 'Awaiting classification' section; we will incorporate these into the next version of this review as appropriate. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing music therapy versus treatment as usual (TAU), psychological therapies, pharmacological therapies, other therapies, or different forms of music therapy for reducing depression. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from all included studies. We calculated standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using the I(superscript 2) statistic. Main results We included in this review nine studies involving a total of 421 participants, 411 of whom were included in the meta-analysis examining short-term effects of music therapy for depression. Concerning primary outcomes, we found moderate-quality evidence of large effects favouring music therapy and TAU over TAU alone for both clinician-rated depressive symptoms (SMD -0.98, 95% CI -1.69 to -0.27, 3 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 219) and patient-reported depressive symptoms (SMD -0.85, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.34, 3 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 142). Music therapy was not associated with more or fewer adverse events than TAU. Regarding secondary outcomes, music therapy plus TAU was superior to TAU alone for anxiety and functioning. Music therapy and TAU was not more effective than TAU alone for improved quality of life (SMD 0.32, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.80, P = 0.20, n = 67, low-quality evidence). We found no significant discrepancies in the numbers of participants who left the study early (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.70, P = 0.26, 5 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 293, moderate-quality evidence). Findings of the present meta-analysis indicate that music therapy added to TAU provides short-term beneficial effects for people with depression if compared to TAU alone. Additionally, we are uncertain about the effects of music therapy versus psychological therapies on clinician-rated depression (SMD -0.78, 95% CI -2.36 to 0.81, 1 RCT, n = 11, very low-quality evidence), patient-reported depressive symptoms (SMD -1.28, 95% CI -3.75 to 1.02, 4 RCTs, n = 131, low-quality evidence), quality of life (SMD -1.31, 95% CI - 0.36 to 2.99, 1 RCT, n = 11, very low-quality evidence), and leaving the study early (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.49, 4 RCTs, n = 157, moderate-quality evidence). We found no eligible evidence addressing adverse events, functioning, and anxiety. We do not know whether one form of music therapy is better than another for clinician-rated depressive symptoms (SMD -0.52, 95% CI -1.87 to 0.83, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low-quality evidence), patient-reported depressive symptoms (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -1.33 to 1.30, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low-quality evidence), quality of life (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -1.57 to 1.08, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low-quality evidence), or leaving the study early (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.46, 1 RCT, n = 10). We found no eligible evidence addressing adverse events, functioning, or anxiety. Authors' conclusions Findings of the present meta-analysis indicate that music therapy provides short-term beneficial effects for people with depression. Music therapy added to treatment as usual (TAU) seems to improve depressive symptoms compared with TAU alone. Additionally, music therapy plus TAU is not associated with more or fewer adverse events than TAU alone. Music therapy also shows efficacy in decreasing anxiety levels and improving functioning of depressed individuals."
Music therapy for people with autism spectrum disorder.	"Background The central impairments of people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affect social interaction and communication. Music therapy uses musical experiences and the relationships that develop through them to enable communication and expression, thus attempting to address some of the core problems of people with ASD. The present version of this review on music therapy for ASD is an update of the original Cochrane review published in 2006. Objectives To assess the effects of music therapy for individuals with ASD. Search methods We searched the following databases in July 2013: CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, ASSIA, Sociological Abstracts, and Dissertation Abstracts International. We also checked the reference lists of relevant studies and contacted investigators in person. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials comparing music therapy or music therapy added to standard care to 'placebo' therapy, no treatment, or standard care for individuals with ASD were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from all included studies. We calculated the pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes to allow the combination data from different scales and to facilitate the interpretation of effect sizes. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Isuperscript digit two] statistic. In cases of statistical heterogeneity within outcome subgroups, we examined clients' age, intensity of therapy (number and frequency of therapy sessions), and treatment approach as possible sources of heterogeneity. Main results We included 10 studies (165 participants) that examined the short- and medium-term effect of music therapy interventions (one week to seven months) for children with ASD. Music therapy was superior to 'placebo' therapy or standard care with respect to the primary outcomes social interaction within the therapy context (SMD 1.06, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.10, 1 RCT, n = 10); generalised social interaction outside of the therapy context (SMD 0.71, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.25, 3 RCTs, n = 57, moderate quality evidence), non-verbal communicative skills within the therapy context (SMD 0.57, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.85, 3 RCTs, n = 30), verbal communicative skills (SMD 0.33, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.49, 6 RCTs, n = 139), initiating behaviour (SMD 0.73, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.11, 3 RCTs, n = 22, moderate quality evidence), and social-emotional reciprocity (SMD 2.28, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.83, 1 RCT, n = 10, low quality evidence). There was no statistically significant difference in non-verbal communicative skills outside of the therapy context (SMD 0.48, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.98, 3 RCTs, n = 57, low quality evidence). Music therapy was also superior to 'placebo' therapy or standard care in secondary outcome areas, including social adaptation (SMD 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.60, 4 RCTs, n = 26), joy (SMD 0.96, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.88, 1 RCT, n = 10), and quality of parent-child relationships (SMD 0.82, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.52, 2 RCTs, n = 33, moderate quality evidence). None of the included studies reported any adverse effects. The small sample sizes of the studies limit the methodological strength of these findings. Authors' conclusions The findings of this updated review provide evidence that music therapy may help children with ASD to improve their skills in primary outcome areas that constitute the core of the condition including social interaction, verbal communication, initiating behaviour, and social-emotional reciprocity. Music therapy may also help to enhance non-verbal communication skills within the therapy context. Furthermore, in secondary outcome areas, music therapy may contribute to increasing social adaptation skills in children with ASD and to promoting the quality of parent-child relationships. In contrast to the studies included in an earlier version of this review published in 2006, the new studies included in this update enhanced the applicability of findings to clinical practice. More research using larger samples and generalised outcome measures is needed to corroborate these findings and to examine whether the effects of music therapy are enduring. When applying the results of this review to practice, it is important to note that the application of music therapy requires specialised academic and clinical training."
Music therapy for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like disorders.	"Background Music therapy is a therapeutic approach that uses musical interaction as a means of communication and expression. Within the area of serious mental disorders, the aim of the therapy is to help people improve their emotional and relational competencies, and address issues they may not be able to using words alone. Objectives To review the effects of music therapy, or music therapy added to standard care, compared with placebo therapy, standard care or no treatment for people with serious mental disorders such as schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Study-Based Register (December 2010 and 15 January, 2015) and supplemented this by contacting relevant study authors, handsearching of music therapy journals and manual searches of reference lists. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared music therapy with standard care, placebo therapy, or no treatment. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently selected, quality assessed and data extracted studies. We excluded data where more than 30% of participants in any group were lost to follow-up. We synthesised non-skewed continuous endpoint data from valid scales using a standardised mean difference (SMD). We employed a fixed-effect model for all analyses. If statistical heterogeneity was found, we examined treatment dosage (i.e. number of therapy sessions) and treatment approach as possible sources of heterogeneity. Main results Ten new studies have been added to this update; 18 studies with a total 1215 participants are now included. These examined effects of music therapy over the short, medium, and long-term, with treatment dosage varying from seven to 240 sessions. Overall, most information is from studies at low or unclear risk of bias Authors' conclusions Moderate- to low-quality evidence suggests that music therapy as an addition to standard care improves the global state, mental state (including negative and general symptoms), social functioning, and quality of life of people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like disorders. However, effects were inconsistent across studies and depended on the number of music therapy sessions as well as the quality of the music therapy provided. Further research should especially address the long-term effects of music therapy, dose-response relationships, as well as the relevance of outcome measures in relation to music therapy."
Music therapy for people with substance use disorders.	"Main objective To assess the effects of music therapy, as a primary or a supportive intervention, compared to standard care, wait-list control or no treatment, for people with substance use disorders, to reduce substance use,the severity of substance dependence/abuse, psychological symptoms, and substance craving; to enhance motivation for change/treatment; and for retention in treatment. Secondary objective To assess the impact of the number of music therapy sessions on study outcomes."
Music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia	"BACKGROUND: Dementia is a clinical syndrome with a number of different causes which is characterised by deterioration in cognitive, behavioural, social and emotional functions. Pharmacological interventions are available but have limited effect to treat many of the syndrome's features. Less research has been directed towards non-pharmacological treatments. In this review, we examined the evidence for effects of music-based interventions. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia on emotional well-being including quality of life, mood disturbance or negative affect, behavioural problems, social behaviour and cognition at the end of therapy and four or more weeks after the end of treatment. SEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG) on 19 June 2017 using the terms: music therapy, music, singing, sing, auditory stimulation. Additional searches were carried out on 19 June 2017 in the major healthcare databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS; and in trial registers and grey literature sources. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials of music-based therapeutic interventions (at least five sessions) for people with dementia that measured any of our outcomes of interest. Control groups either received usual care or other activities with or without music. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors worked independently to screen the retrieved studies against the inclusion criteria and then to extract data and assess methodological quality of the included studies. If necessary, we contacted trial authors to ask for additional data, including relevant subscales, or for other missing information. We pooled data using random-effects models. MAIN RESULTS: We included 22 studies with 1097 randomised participants. Twenty-one studies with 890 participants contributed data to meta-analyses. Participants in the studies had dementia of varying degrees of severity, and all were resident in institutions. Seven studies delivered an individual music intervention; the other studies delivered the intervention to groups of participants. Most interventions involved both active and receptive musical elements. The methodological quality of the studies varied. All were at high risk of performance bias and some were at high risk of detection or other bias.At the end of treatment, we found low-quality evidence that the interventions may improve emotional well-being and quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.62; 9 studies, 348 participants) and reduce anxiety (SMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.14; 13 studies, 478 participants). We found low-quality evidence that music-based therapeutic interventions may have little or no effect on cognition (SMD 0.15, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.36; 7 studies, 350 participants). There was moderate-quality evidence that the interventions reduce depressive symptoms (SMD -0.27, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.09; 11 studies, 503 participants) and overall behaviour problems (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.01; 10 studies, 442 participants), but do not decrease agitation or aggression (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.10; 14 studies, 626 participants). The quality of the evidence on social behaviour was very low, so effects were very uncertain.The evidence for long-term outcomes measured four or more weeks after the end of treatment was of very low quality for anxiety and social behaviour, and for the other outcomes, it was of low quality for little or no effect (with small SMDs, between 0.03 and 0.34). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Providing people with dementia who are in institutional care with at least five sessions of a music-based therapeutic intervention probably reduces depressive symptoms and improves overall behavioural problems at the end of treatment. It may also improve emotional well-being and quality of life and reduce anxiety, but may have little or no effect on agitation or aggression or on cognition. We are uncertain about effects on social behaviour and about long-term effects. Future studies should examine the duration of effects in relation to the overall duration of treatment and the number of sessions."
Needle exchange programs for the prevention of hepatitis C virus infection in people who inject drugs: A systematic review with meta-analysis.	"Background: Previous research on the effectiveness of needle exchange programs (NEP) in preventing hepatitis C virus (HCV) in people who inject drugs (PWID) has shown mixed findings. The purpose of this study was to use the meta-analytic approach to examine the association between NEP use and HCV prevention in PWIDs. Methods: Study inclusion criteria were (1) observational studies, (2) PWIDs, (3) NEP use, (4) HCV status ascertained by serological testing, (5) studies published in any language since January 1, 1989, and (6) data available for measures of association. Studies were located by searching four electronic databases and cross-referencing. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa (NOS) scale. A ratio measure of association was calculated for each result from cohort or case-control studies and pooled using a random effects model. Odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) models were analyzed separately. Results were considered statistically significant if the 95% confidence interval (CI) did not cross 1. Heterogeneity was estimated using Q and I 2 with alpha values for Q with alpha values for Q with alpha values for Q 2 >= 66%) were observed for both models. Conclusions: The impact of NEPs on HCV prevention in PWIDs remains unclear. There is a need for well-designed research studies employing standardized criteria and measurements to clarify this issue.

Needs of siblings of persons with psychosis: a systematic descriptive review	"Research on caregivers of psychosis has predominantly focused on parents and spouses. Issues related to siblings of persons with psychosis (SOPP) are yet to be evaluated comprehensively. Like parents and spouses, SOPP also share the caregiver burden and have their own issues and needs. This systematic descriptive review aims to identify the types of needs of SOPP in the published literature and gives implications for further practice and research. The primary data search was carried out with predefined protocol in PubMed database and an additional hand search was done in EBSCOhost, ProQuest, Scopus, and PsychINFO. All the searches yielded a total of 862 titles. After screening for necessary inclusion criteria, seven studies were included in the final review. The results are discussed under six major themes that emerged from this review. Six out of seven studies highlighted the need for information on siblings' illness and participation in caregiver support group. Other important needs were illness management or rehabilitation needs; help in managing their own psychosocial issues; treatment related informational needs; and inclusion in treatment process. The socio-demographic details of these studies showed that majority of the participants were female siblings of Caucasian or white British ethnicity and from developed countries. SOPP predominantly have specific needs such as informational and support group needs, which are different in the priority of other primary caregiver needs. Paucity of literature from developing countries and the limitations of the existing studies warrant further systematic research."
Needs of Stroke Survivors as Perceived by Their Caregivers: A Scoping Review	"Objective: Caregivers usually are not involved while planning the stroke survivor's medical and rehabilitation goals and interventions. This review aimed to identify the needs of stroke survivors as perceived by their caregivers. Design: A literature search from 2003 to 2014 was conducted using Medline, CINAHL, PsychINFO, and Google Scholar. Sixty-six studies were included. Most studies excluded did not encompass caregivers' perspectives. Four reviewers screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the articles for inclusion. The data extracted from these studies were synthetized into metathemes. Results: Fifty-two qualitative, ten quantitative survey, and four mixed-methods studies were included in the final synthesis. The studies came from 11 countries. The data synthesis produced following three metathemes: (a) body functional needs, including psychological function, physical function, cognitive function, and uncertainty related to function; (b) activity and participatory needs, including healthy lifestyle, physical activities, speech, independence, cognitive activities, and uncertainty related to activities and participation; and (c) environmental needs, encompassing support, services, safety, accommodation and accessibility, and uncertainty related to environmental factors. Conclusions: This scoping review identified a range of needs of stroke survivors as perceived by their caregivers. Incorporating the caregiver's preferences and values into clinical decisions may improve outcomes among stroke survivors."

New parents' experience of information and sense of security related to postnatal care: A systematic review.	"BACKGROUND: Becoming a parent is often a tumultuous experience and a great challenge. The transition when a child is born is described affecting the parents and their relationship psychically, physically, mentally and emotionally. Information within care should be relevant and supportive. Furthermore information within the context of care should be relevant, supportive and helpful to parents in handling their new situation and increasing their self-reliance. AIM: To provide a contextualised understanding of how parents experience postnatal care in relation to information and sense of security"". METHOD: A systematic search was undertaken at PubMed and CINAHL database for literature published between January 2002 and August 2017. Inclusion criteria focused on postnatal care. Eight of the studies used qualitative methods and two of the studies used quantitative methods, as a result the findings could not be combined using meta-analysis or meta-synthesis, instead narrative synthesis of the findings were used. RESULTS: Ten studies were included. The analysis revealed three categories related to parent's experience of information and sense of security during the postnatal period. These categories were; Expectations on the care; Own resources; and Confirmation. Support from staff and family is described as significant for the parents' sense of security. During the first postnatal week, the emotions were characterized by anxiety and/or fear. Parents prefer a ""non-judgmental"" attitude from the staff and to be met as an individual. CONCLUSION: Family -centred care such as continuity, participation, individually adaptation, consistent, information and preparation for parenting appear to be important components for parents' sense of security in postnatal care.

New parents' experiences of postpartum depression: a systematic review of qualitative evidence.	"OBJECTIVES: The objective of the review was to synthesize the evidence on new mothers' and fathers' experiences of postpartum depression (PPD). INTRODUCTION: Postpartum depression is a form of clinical depression that affects women and, less frequently, men, typically during the first months after childbirth. It has been estimated that 10% to 20% of women and 10% of men suffer from postpartum depression, and it may have serious consequences for mothers, fathers and their children. Therefore, this review covers the experiences of both mothers and fathers. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This qualitative review considered studies that included new mothers and fathers who had any number of children and who experienced PPD within a one-year postpartum period. The phenomenon of interest was the lived experience of new mothers and fathers with PPD. Qualitative studies including, but not limited to, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research and feminist research were considered. METHODS: The review systematically searched the following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus and the Finnish database MEDIC. In addition, the search for unpublished articles included the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed independently by two reviewers, and qualitative data were extracted from papers by two independent reviewers using a standardized data extraction tool. Qualitative research findings were pooled using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. RESULTS: Thirteen papers that considered mothers' (n = 199) experiences of PPD were included in the review. A total of 98 findings were extracted and aggregated into 14 categories, and from them, four synthesized findings were developed: i) Depressed mothers feel unable to control their own lives due to low resilience; ii) The ambivalent feelings depressed mothers experience towards their babies, partners and in-laws cause distress and suffering; iii) Depressed mothers experience anger and despair if they perceive imbalances between their support needs and the support they get from healthcare providers and significant others; and iv) Depressed mothers experience hopelessness and helplessness resulting from their new-found motherhood and financial worries. Two papers that considered fathers' (n = 20) experiences of PPD were included in the review. A total of 19 findings were extracted and aggregated into six categories, and from them, two synthesized findings were developed: i) Depressed fathers experience disappointment arising from perceived imbalances between their support needs and the support they get from their partner and significant others; and ii) Depressed fathers are more imbalanced after childbirth than fathers who are not suffering from PPD, so they feel unable to control their own lives due to low resilience. CONCLUSIONS: The qualitative studies concerning new parents' experiences of PPD have focused on the mother's perspective, and studies of the father's perspective, especially of the father's own experiences of PPD, are scarce. Both mothers and fathers did not receive enough support from their significant others. In addition, mothers wanted more support from health professionals. Because PPD has a great influence on the wellbeing of mothers and fathers, as well as children, it is important to understand what parents undergo after childbirth."
No title	"BACKGROUND: Patient and public involvement (PPI) is a prerequisite for many funding bodies and NHS research ethics approval. PPI in research is defined as research carried out with or by the public rather than to, about or for them. While the benefits of PPI have been widely discussed, there is a lack of evidence on the impact and outcomes of PPI in research. OBJECTIVES: To determine the types of PPI in funded research, describe key processes, analyse the contextual and temporal dynamics of PPI and explore the experience of PPI in research for all those involved. Mechanisms contributing to the routine incorporation of PPI in the research process were assessed, the impact of PPI on research processes and outcomes evaluated, and barriers and enablers to effective PPI identified. DESIGN: A three-staged realist evaluation drawing on Normalisation Process Theory to understand how far PPI was embedded within health-care research in six areas: diabetes mellitus, arthritis, cystic fibrosis, dementia, public health and learning disabilities. The first two stages comprised a scoping exercise and online survey to chief investigators to assess current PPI activity. The third stage consisted of case studies tracked over 18 months through interviews and document analysis. The research was conducted in four regions of England. PARTICIPANTS: Non-commercial studies currently running or completed within the previous 2 years eligible for adoption on the UK Clinical Research Network portfolio. A total of 129 case study participants included researchers and PPI representatives from 22 research studies, and representatives from funding bodies and PPI networks. RESULTS: In the scoping 51% (n = 92) of studies had evidence of PPI and in the survey 79% (n = 80), with funder requirements and study design the strongest influence on the extent of PPI. There was little transparency about PPI in publicly accessible information. In case studies, context-mechanism-outcome configurations suggested that six salient actions were required for effective PPI. These were a clear purpose, role and structure for PPI; ensuring diversity; whole research team engagement with PPI; mutual understanding and trust between the researchers and lay representatives; ensuring opportunities for PPI throughout the research process; and reflecting on, appraising and evaluating PPI within a research study. PPI models included a 'one-off' model with limited PPI, a fully intertwined model in which PPI was fully embedded and an outreach model with lay representatives linking to broader communities. Enabling contexts included funder, topic/design, resources, research host, organisation of PPI and, most importantly, relationships. In some case studies, lack of coherence in defining PPI persisted, with evidence of a dual role of PPI representative/study participant. Evidence of PPI outcomes included changes to study design, improvements to recruitment materials and rates, and dissemination. CONCLUSIONS: Six salient actions were required for effective PPI and were characterised by a shared understanding of moral and methodological purposes of PPI, a key individual co-ordinating PPI, ensuring diversity, a research team positive about PPI input and fully engaged with it, based on relationships that were established and maintained over time, and PPI being evaluated in a proactive and systematic approach. Future work recommendations include exploring the impact of virtual PPI, cost analysis and economic evaluation of the different models of PPI, and a longer-term follow-up study of the outcomes of PPI on research findings and impact on services and clinical practice.

Normalizing suffering: A meta-synthesis of experiences of and perspectives on pain and pain management in nursing homes.	"Older people who live in nursing homes commonly suffer from pain. Therefore, relieving suffering among older people that stems from pain demands knowledge improvement through an integration of international knowledge. This study aimed to integrate current international findings and strengthen the understanding of older people's experiences of and perspectives on pain and pain management in nursing homes. A meta-synthesis study using Noblit and Hare's interpretative meta-ethnography approach was conducted. Empirical research papers from journals were collected from various databases. The search process and appraisal determined six articles for inclusion. Two studies were conducted in the US and one each in Iceland, Norway, the UK, and Australia. The older people's experiences of pain as well as perspectives on pain management from all involved (older people, their family members, and healthcare staff) were integrated into a theoretical model using three themes of ""identity of pain,"" ""recognition of pain,"" and ""response to pain."" The metaphor of ""normalizing suffering"" was devised to illustrate the meaning of pain experiences and pain management in nursing homes. Society's common attitude that pain is unavoidable and therefore acceptable in old age in society-among older people themselves as well as those who are responsible for reporting, acknowledging, and relieving pain-must change. The article emphasizes that pain as a primary source of suffering can be relieved, provided that older people are encouraged to report their pain. In addition, healthcare staff require sufficient training to take a person-centered approach towards assessment and management of pain that considers all elements of pain."

"Nurses"" Unique Opportunity to Promote Patient Engagement in Prenatal Care"	"AIM: To report an analysis of the concept of patient engagement in prenatal care. BACKGROUND: Engagement in health care has been widely discussed but vaguely defined. Patients benefit more from their health care when they are fully engaged in their care. Patient engagement in prenatal care is an important element of prenatal care utilization that has not been analyzed, standardized as a concept, or measured. DESIGN: Concept analysis. DATA SOURCES: CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO databases, and the internet were searched for literature published in English with a focus on peer-reviewed journals from disciplines of business, allied health sciences, health administration, psychology, and nursing, focusing on the period of 2010Äì2015. METHODS: Hybrid version of the Walker and Avant concept analysis method (2011). RESULTS: This concept analysis provides 4 defining attributes of patient engagement in prenatal care and a table of related empirical referents of engagement. These elements offer a foundation for further nursing scholarship toward measurement and evaluation of patient engagement in prenatal care. CONCLUSION: Patient engagement in prenatal care represents a human response to a health condition. Efforts to increase patient engagement in health care are best addressed by the nursing profession through continued research and intervention development."
Obesity prevention interventions in early childhood education and care settings with parental involvement: A systematic review	"Partnering early childhood education and care (ECEC) and the home together may be more effective in combating obesogenic risk factors in preschool children. Thus, an evaluation of ECEC obesity prevention interventions with a parental component was conducted, exploring parental engagement and its effect on obesity and healthy lifestyle outcomes. A search revealed 15 peer-reviewed papers. Some studies demonstrated positive weight changes, and secondary outcomes of changes in physical activity and healthy eating were reported in most studies; study quality ranged from fair to good. Four findings were linked to weight changes: (1) when educational material is consistent across settings; (2) capacity building of parents; (3) parents encouraging their children to drink water and (4) parental satisfaction and participation. A partnership between parents and ECEC may be a powerful force in the prevention of paediatric obesity. A better understanding of collaborative parental engagement is needed.

Objective and subjective cognitive impairment following chemotherapy for cancer: a systematic review	"Evidence suggests that some cancer survivors experience cognitive difficulties following chemotherapy. However, perceived or subjective cognitive impairment is more frequently reported than prevalence revealed by objective assessments. The aim of this review was to examine the relationship between subjective and objective measures of cognitive impairment following treatment for cancer and to determine the number of studies that found a significant relationship between these measures of cognition. A comprehensive search for articles, published between 1980 and 2012, comparing subjective and objective cognition in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy was conducted. Of 818 potentially relevant articles, 23 studies met the inclusion criteria for the current review and one article was sourced from reference lists of included studies. Only eight of 24 included studies found a significant relationship between objective and subjective measures of cognitive performance. These studies were more likely to involve breast cancer patients and to assess the relationship between memory and perceived cognitive impairment. The failure to consistently find an association between subjective and objective measures of cognition could be explained by variations in assessment methods or the definition of impairment. Alternatively, objective and perceived cognitive impairment may be unrelated because perceived impairment may be an indicator of psychological distress rather than cognitive impairment. Despite these discrepancies, patients' perceptions of impairment are important due to its significant impact on quality of life. Further research is required to explore whether objective measures of everyday functioning better predict the impact of chemotherapy related cognitive impairment on daily functioning.

Observational Park-based physical activity studies: A systematic review of the literature	"This article reports the outcomes of a systematic review of observational park-based physical activity (PA) studies. Five electronic databases and the Active Living Research website were searched in July 2015 to identify relevant articles. Studies were included if they: a) reported observational data collected at outdoor park-based settings during free living conditions, b) reported results of a park audit, c) included PA as an outcome measure of the park audit, and d) were published after 1990 in English-language peer-review journals. Thirty-two articles, reporting outcomes of 26 unique studies, met inclusion criteria for review. Most studies (n=20, 87%) had cross-sectional or non-interventional study designs, while 6 (23%) employed quasi-experimental designs. Studies were predominately conducted in the U.S. (n=19, 76%). The median number of park users across studies was 4558 (Range=815 to 76,632). Approximately half (51%) of all park users were female. Eighty-one percent of studies (n=21) reported PA outcomes for individuals of all ages, while 4 studies (15%) reported PA outcomes for children only and 1 study (4%) for adults only. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) of park users ranged from 31% to 85% (Median=55.0%). Studies conducted in the U.S. reported a slightly higher median number of park-users engaging in MVPA than those outside the U.S. (60.5% vs. 52.8%). Fifteen studies examined gender differences in MVPA. Among these, 12 (87%) reported more males engaging in MVPA than females."
"Older African Americans and the HIV Care Continuum: A Systematic Review of the Literature, 2003Äì2018"	"Evidence suggests that racial disparities in the HIV care continuum persist in older age groups, particularly among African Americans. The objective of this systematic review was to identify factors that facilitate or hinder older African Americans' engagement in the HIV care continuum. For studies published between 2003 and 2018, we: (1) searched databases using keywords, (2) excluded non-peer-reviewed studies, (3) limited findings to older African Americans and the HIV care continuum, and (4) retrieved and summarized data focused on barriers and facilitators of the HIV care continuum. Among the 1023 studies extracted, 13 were included: diagnosis/testing (n = 1), engagement in care (n = 7), and antiretroviral adherence (n = 5). Barriers included lack of HIV risk awareness, routine testing, and healthcare access, stigma, and multimorbidities. Social support, health/medication literacy, and increased self-efficacy facilitated engagement. A targeted focus on older African Americans is needed to achieve national goals of improving HIV care and treatment outcomes.; Resumen: La evidencia sugiere que disparidades raciales en el cuidado continuo del VIH persisten en los grupos de mayor edad, particularmente entre los afroamericanos. El objetivo de esta revisi??n sistem?°tica fue identificar los factores que facilitan u obstaculizan la participaci??n de afroamericanos mayores en el cuidado continuo del VIH. Con respecto a los estudios publicados entre el 2003 y el 2018, nosotros: (1) revisamos bases de datos usando palabras claves, (2) excluimos estudios no revisados por pares, (3) limitamos los resultados a afroamericanos mayores y el cuidado continuo del VIH, y (4) recuperamos y resumimos datos concentrados en las barreras y facilitadores al cuidado continuo del VIH. De los 1023 estudios extra??dos, se incluyeron 13: diagn??stico/prueba (n = 1), participaci??n en el cuidado (n = 7) y adhesi??n antirretroviral (n = 5). Algunas de las barreras incluidas fueron la falta de conciencia de riesgo del VIH, las pruebas rutinarias, y el acceso al cuidado m?©dico, el estigma y las multi-morbosidades. El apoyo social, el conocimiento sobre la salud/medicamentos y una mayor auto-eficacia facilitaron la participaci??n. Para lograr los objetivos nacionales de mejorar el cuidado del VIH y los resultados de tratamiento es necesario enfocarse en afroamericanos mayores."
"Older people, assistive technologies, and the barriers to adoption: A systematic review"	"Background: Older people generally prefer to continue living in their own homes rather than move into residential age care institutions. Assistive technologies and sensors in the home environment and/or bodily worn systems that monitor people's movement might contribute to an increased sense of safety and security at home. However, their use can raise ethical anxieties as little is known about how older persons perceive assistive and monitoring technologies.Objectives: To review the main barriers to the adoption of assistive technologies (ATs) by older adults in order to uncover issues of concern from empirical studies and to arrange these issues from the most critical to the least critical.Method: A 4-step systematic review was conducted using empirical studies: locating and identifying relevant articles; screening of located articles; examination of full text articles for inclusion/exclusion; and detail examination of the 44 articles included.Results: Privacy is a top critical concern to older adults, registering a 34% of the total articles examined. Two other equally potent barriers to the adoption of ATs were trust and functionality/added value representing 27 and 25 per cent each respectively of the total studies examined. Also of serious concerns are cost of ATs and ease of use and suitability for daily use (23%) each respectively, perception of ""no need"" (20%), stigma (18%), and fear of dependence and lack of training (16%) each respectively. These underlying factors are generation/cohort effects and physical decline relating to aging, and negative attitudes toward technologies such as the so-called ""gerontechnologies"" specifically targeting older adults. However, more and more older adults adopt different kinds of ATs in order to fit in with the society.Conclusions: The identified underlying factors are generation/cohort effects and physical decline relating to aging, and negative attitudes toward technologies. The negative attitudes that are most frequently associated with technologies such as the so-called ""gerontechnologies"" specifically targeting older adults contain stigmatizing symbolism that might prevent them from adopting them."
Older people's participation in and engagement with falls prevention interventions in community settings: an augment to the Cochrane systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of fall prevention conducted in community settings have recently been systematically reviewed. OBJECTIVE: To augment this review by analysing older people's participation in the trials and engagement with the interventions. DESIGN: Review of the 99 single and multifactorial RCTs included in the Cochrane systematic review of falls prevention interventions. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 60+/mean age minus one standard deviation of 60+. METHODS: Calculated aggregate data on recruitment (proportion who accepted the invitation to participate), attrition at 12 month follow-up (loss of participants), adherence (to intervention protocol) and whether adherence moderated the effect of interventions on trial outcomes. RESULTS: The median recruitment rate was 70.7% (64.2-81.7%, n = 78). At 12 months the median attrition rate including mortality was 10.9% (9.1-16.0%, n = 44). Adherence rates (n = 69) were >=80% for vitamin D/calcium supplementation; >=70% for walking and class-based exercise; 52% for individually targeted exercise; approximately 60-70% for fluid/nutrition therapy and interventions to increase knowledge; 58-59% for home modifications; but there was no improvement for medication review/withdrawal of certain drugs. Adherence to multifactorial interventions was generally >=75% but ranged 28-95% for individual components. The 13 studies that tested for whether adherence moderated treatment effectiveness produced mixed results. CONCLUSIONS: Using median rates for recruitment (70%), attrition (10%) and adherence (80%), we estimate that, at 12 months, on average half of community-dwelling older people are likely to be adhering to falls prevention interventions in clinical trials."
Older people's perspectives on participation in physical activity: a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative literature	"BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity accounts for 9% of all deaths worldwide and is among the top 10 risk factors for global disease burden. Nearly half of people aged over 60 years are inactive. Efforts to identify which factors influence physical activity behaviour are needed. OBJECTIVE: To identify and synthesise the range of barriers and facilitators to physical activity participation. METHODS: Systematic review of qualitative studies on the perspectives of physical activity among people aged 60 years and over. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO and AMED were searched. Independent raters assessed comprehensiveness of reporting of included studies. Thematic synthesis was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: From 132 studies involving 5987 participants, we identified six major themes: social influences (valuing interaction with peers, social awkwardness, encouragement from others, dependence on professional instruction); physical limitations (pain or discomfort, concerns about falling, comorbidities); competing priorities; access difficulties (environmental barriers, affordability); personal benefits of physical activity (strength, balance and flexibility, self-confidence, independence, improved health and mental well-being); and motivation and beliefs (apathy, irrelevance and inefficacy, maintaining habits). CONCLUSIONS: Some older people still believe that physical activity is unnecessary or even potentially harmful. Others recognise the benefits of physical activity, but report a range of barriers to physical activity participation. Strategies to enhance physical activity participation among older people should include (1) raising awareness of the benefits and minimise the perceived risks of physical activity and (2) improving the environmental and financial access to physical activity opportunities.

OMERACT Quality-adjusted Life-years (QALY) Working Group: Do Current QALY Measures Capture What Matters to Patients?.	"OBJECTIVE: To understand the limitations with current patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) used to generate quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) in rheumatology, and set a research agenda. METHODS: Two activities were undertaken. The first was a scoping review of published studies that have used PROM to generate QALY in rheumatology between 2011 and 2016. The second was an interactive ""eyeball test"" exercise at Outcome Measures in Rheumatology 13 that compared subdomains of widely used generic PROM, as identified through the scoping review, to subdomains of the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis Health Index (ASAS-HI) condition-specific PROM for ankylosing spondylitis. RESULTS: The scoping review included 39 studies. Five different PROM have been used to generate QALY in rheumatology; however, the EQ-5D and Short Form 6 Dimensions (SF-6D) were used most frequently (in 32 and 9 of included studies, respectively). Special interest group participants identified energy/drive and sleep as 2 key subdomains of the ASAS-HI instrument that may be missed by the EQ-5D, and sexual function as potentially missed by the SF-6D. Participants also expressed concerns that aspects of the process of care and non-health outcomes may be missed. Three ways of incorporating additional subdomains were discussed, including using an alternative generic PROM, modifying an existing generic PROM with ""bolt-on"" subdomain(s), and generating societal weights for a condition-specific PROM. CONCLUSION: Three priorities for future research were identified: understanding whether the EQ-5D and SF-6D identify what matters to patients with different rheumatic conditions, analyzing how much patients value process or non-health outcomes, and identifying which approaches to incorporating a greater number of subdomains into the QALY are being undertaken in other disease areas."
One-to-one dietary interventions undertaken in a dental setting to change dietary behaviour.	"Background The dental care setting is an appropriate place to deliver dietary assessment and advice as part of patient management. However, we do not know whether this is effective in changing dietary behaviour. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of one-to-one dietary interventions for all ages carried out in a dental care setting in changing dietary behaviour. The effectiveness of these interventions in the subsequent changing of oral and general health is also assessed. Search methods The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 24 January 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 24 January 2012), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 24 January 2012), CINAHL via EBSCO (1982 to 24 January 2012), PsycINFO via OVID (1967 to 24 January 2012), and Web of Science (1945 to 12 April 2011). We also undertook an electronic search of key conference proceedings (IADR and ORCA between 2000 and 13 July 2011). Reference lists of relevant articles, thesis publications (Dissertations Abstracts Online 1861 to 2011) were searched. The authors of eligible trials were contacted to identify any unpublished work. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of one-to-one dietary interventions delivered in a dental care setting. Data collection and analysis screening, eligibility screening and data extraction decisions were all carried out independently and in duplicate by two review authors. Consensus between the two opinions was achieved by discussion, or involvement of a third review author. Main results Five studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Two of these were multi-intervention studies where the dietary intervention was one component of a wider programme of prevention, but where data on dietary behaviour change were reported. One of the single intervention studies was concerned with dental caries prevention. The other two concerned general health outcomes. There were no studies concerned with dietary change aimed at preventing tooth erosion. In four out of the five included studies a significant change in dietary behaviour was found for at least one of the primary outcome variables. Authors' conclusions There is some evidence that one-to-one dietary interventions in the dental setting can change behaviour, although the evidence is greater for interventions aiming to change fruit/vegetable and alcohol consumption than for those aiming to change dietary sugar consumption. There is a need for more studies, particularly in the dental practice setting, as well as greater methodological rigour in the design, statistical analysis and reporting of such studies."
Online support groups for women with breast cancer.	"Background Survival rates for women with a diagnosis of breast cancer continue to improve. However, some women may experience physical, psychological and emotional effects post diagnosis, throughout treatment and beyond. Support groups can provide opportunities for people to share their experiences and learn from others. As the number of online support groups increases, more and more women with breast cancer will likely access them. Objectives To assess effects of online support groups on the emotional distress, uncertainty, anxiety, depression and quality of life (QoL) of women with breast cancer. Search methods We searched for trials in the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO on 2 May 2016, and we handsearched journals and reference lists. We also searched the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) search portal and clinicaltrials.gov on 2 May 2016. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing effects of online support groups on women with a diagnosis of breast cancer and women who have completed breast cancer treatment. We included studies comparing online support groups with a usual care group, and studies comparing two or more types of online support groups (without a usual care group). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We presented outcome data using mean differences (MDs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and we used the fixed-effect model when appropriate. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We included six studies (492 women) that assessed online support groups for women with breast cancer. Online support groups in these six trials lasted from six to 30 weeks. Women participated in these groups between 1.5 and 2.5 hours per week, and investigators conducted all studies in the USA. Participants were predominantly white and well educated and were moderate to high earners. Four studies compared an online support group versus a control group, and the other two compared a 'moderated' versus a 'peer-led' online support group, and a 'standard' versus an 'enhanced' online support group, respectively. Authors' conclusions This review did not find the evidence required to show whether participation in online support groups was beneficial for women with breast cancer, because identified trials were small and of low or very low quality. Large, rigorous trials with ethnically and economically diverse participants are needed to provide robust evidence regarding the psychosocial outcomes selected for this review."
Optimal patient education for cancer pain: a systematic review and theory-based meta-analysis	"PURPOSE: Previous systematic reviews have found patient education to be moderately efficacious in decreasing the intensity of cancer pain, but variation in results warrants analysis aimed at identifying which strategies are optimal. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken using a theory-based approach to classifying and comparing educational interventions for cancer pain. The reference lists of previous reviews and MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL were searched in May 2012. Studies had to be published in a peer-reviewed English language journal and compare the effect on cancer pain intensity of education with usual care. Meta-analyses used standardized effect sizes (ES) and a random effects model. Subgroup analyses compared intervention components categorized using the Michie et al. (Implement Sci 6:42, 2011) capability, opportunity, and motivation behavior (COM-B) model. RESULTS: Fifteen randomized controlled trials met the criteria. As expected, meta-analysis identified a small-moderate ES favoring education versus usual care (ES, 0.27 -0.47, -0.07]; P = 0.007) with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 71 %). Subgroup analyses based on the taxonomy found that interventions using ""enablement"" were efficacious (ES, 0.35 -0.63, -0.08]; P = 0.01), whereas those lacking this component were not (ES, 0.18 -0.46, 0.10]; P = 0.20). However, the subgroup effect was nonsignificant (P = 0.39), and heterogeneity was not reduced. Factoring in the variable of individualized versus non-individualized influenced neither efficacy nor heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: The current meta-analysis follows a trend in using theory to understand the mechanisms of complex interventions. We suggest that future efforts focus on interventions that target patient self-efficacy. Authors are encouraged to report comprehensive details of interventions and methods to inform synthesis, replication, and refinement."
Oral Health Programmes in Indigenous Communities Worldwide-Lessons learned from the field: A qualitative systematic review	"OBJECTIVES: This systematic review examines the evidence on the effectiveness of programmes that aim to improve the oral health of Indigenous populations worldwide, as well as presents a qualitative analysis to explore the design and implementation of these initiatives. METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Studies were included if they described an oral health programme for an Indigenous population in any country worldwide. A thematic synthesis of the qualitative findings was undertaken for each study's results and discussion sections. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included. Sixteen studies reported positive results, twelve of which reported statistically significant findings. Three themes regarding design and implementation emerged from the qualitative analysis: (i) elements of successful programmes, (ii) challenges and barriers to successful interventions and (iii) suggestions for improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Successful programmes considered cultural appropriateness in their design-including extensive community engagement before, during and after implementation to enhance ownership of, and thus participation in the programme. Collaborative approaches were seen as an advantage, not only with Indigenous communities, but also with local health providers and organizations, with particular emphasis on incorporation into existing services. Challenges included low community participation, unstable funding and staffing issues. In addition, future programmes should also incorporate advocacy and community development, focus on changes to public policy, utilize evidence-based interventions that include traditional models of health, attempt to secure a stable funding base, target strategies to ensure staff retention and develop interventions that target the multilevel causes of general and oral health. This review provides an evidence base that can aid in the successful design, implementation and sustainability of oral health programmes for Indigenous people in the future.

Our disease: a qualitative meta-synthesis of the experiences of spousal/partner caregivers of people with multiple sclerosis	"PURPOSE: To provide a unique and conceptually comprehensive account of the lived experiences of caregiving spouses/partners of people with multiple sclerosis, which can be used to better enable health professionals to provide appropriate support services. METHOD: A systematic review of qualitative studies reporting the experiences of caregiving spouses/partners was conducted. Relevant articles were identified and analysed using a meta-ethnographic synthesis. RESULTS: Twenty studies met eligibility criteria, of which 18 were included in the final meta-synthesis. Six major concepts were identified: Acceptance and Appreciation, Commitment, Becoming the Carer, Living with Loss, Shifting Sands and Setbacks with Services. A model of carer experience is presented as a line of argument to synthesise the findings. Suggestions are made regarding the types of supportive interventions that might be effective for spousal carers. CONCLUSION: The findings increase our understanding about the experiences of partners caring for people with multiple sclerosis. Spousal carers can adapt to the challenges associated with change and loss, and have the potential to develop appreciation, acceptance and hope. Services need to be sensitive to the fluctuating demands placed upon carers and be flexible in their support. Copyright ¬© 2018 Nordic College of Caring Science."
Outcomes for residential or inpatient intensive treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	"Little data exist to inform the treatment of severe or treatment refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in an inpatient or residential setting. We aimed to determine effect size of inpatient, residential or day-patient program in people with OCD. Studies were selected if they were conducted in an inpatient, day-patient or residential setting; were using the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) as an outcome measure; treatment included cognitive behavior therapy; it involved adult patients; and had a sample size of at least 20. We identified 19 studies with a total of 2306 participants at admission. We extracted the mean and standard deviation pre-admission and at discharge. The overall reduction was 10.7 points (95% CI: 9.8-11.5, z=24.2 p<0.001) with an effect size, Hedges g, of 1.87. Being married or cohabiting consistently predicted better outcomes, and symptoms of hoarding or comorbid alcohol misuse consistently predicted worse outcomes. Clients with severe or treatment refractory OCD can make significant improvements with intensive residential or inpatient therapy but little is known either about its long term benefits or cost effectiveness compared with an alternative. Programs are offered internationally with a variety of inclusion criteria. We discuss how such programs might be optimized."
Outcomes of using telehealth for the provision of healthcare to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people: a systematic review	"OBJECTIVE: To examine reported outcomes of health services delivered by telehealth to Indigenous Australians. METHODS: Systematic review of the literature. Searches were conducted to identify articles that reported a telehealth service used to provide clinical services to Indigenous Australians. Articles were screened for inclusion using pre-defined criteria. Findings were synthesised narratively and reported using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: 14 articles, describing 11 distinct telehealth services, were selected based on the inclusion criteria. Authors of included studies report that telehealth has improved social and emotional wellbeing, clinical outcomes and access to health services for Indigenous Australians. Further, it has reduced travel and improved screening rates. Indigenous people report positive perceptions of their telehealth interaction. CONCLUSION: Telehealth is used to address poor accessibility to health services and for targeted screening programs for at risk populations. Reported outcomes from existing services demonstrate the potential of telehealth for health service delivery for Indigenous Australians. Confidence in the findings of this review is reduced by the predominance of descriptive studies and small sample sizes in many of the included articles. IMPLICATIONS: Telehealth models of care facilitated through partnerships between Aboriginal community-controlled health services and public hospitals may improve both patient outcomes and access to specialist services for Indigenous people.

Outside-of-school time obesity prevention and treatment interventions in African American youth.	"Outside-of-school time (OST; i.e. before/after-school hours, summer time), theory-based interventions are potential strategies for addressing increased obesity among African American youth. This review assessed interventions across multiple settings that took place during OST among African American youth aged 5-18 years old. Seven databases were searched for studies published prior to October 2013; 28 prevention and treatment interventions that assessed weight or related behaviours as a primary or secondary outcome were identified. Overall, these studies reported heterogeneous intervention length, theoretical frameworks, methodological quality, outcomes, cultural adaption and community engagement; the latter two attributes have been identified as potentially important intervention strategies when working with African Americans. Although not always significant, generally, outcomes were in the desired direction. When examining programmes by time of intervention (i.e. after-school, summer time, time not specified or multiple time periods), much of the variability remained, but some similarities emerged. After-school studies generally had a positive impact on physical activity, fruit/vegetable consumption and caloric intake, or body composition. The single summer time intervention showed a trend towards reduced body mass index. Overall findings suggest that after-school and summer programmes, alone or perhaps in combination, offer potential benefits for African American youth and could favourably influence diet and physical activity behaviour."
Overcoming Barriers to Integrating Behavioral Health and Primary Care Services	"OBJECTIVE: Despite barriers, organizations with varying characteristics have achieved full integration of primary care services with providers and services that identify, treat, and manage those with mental health and substance use disorders. What are the key factors and common themes in stories of this success? METHODS: A systematic literature review and snowball sampling technique was used to identify organizations. Site visits and key informant interviews were conducted with 6 organizations that had over time integrated behavioral health and primary care services. Case studies of each organization were independently coded to identify traits common to multiple organizations. RESULTS: Common characteristics include prioritized vulnerable populations, extensive community collaboration, team approaches that included the patient and family, diversified funding streams, and data-driven approaches and practices. CONCLUSIONS: While significant barriers to integrating behavioral health and primary care services exist, case studies of organizations that have successfully overcome these barriers share certain common factors.

"Overview of systematic reviews: Effective home support in dementia care, components and impacts-Stage 1, psychosocial interventions for dementia"	"AIM: To synthesize evidence to identify the components of effective psychosocial interventions in dementia care to inform clinical practice, policy and research. BACKGROUND: With population ageing, dementia represents a significant care challenge with 60% of people with dementia living at home. DESIGN: Overview of systematic reviews with narrative summary. DATA SOURCES: Electronic searches of published systematic reviews in English using Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE and EPPI-Centre, between September 2013 - April 2014. REVIEW METHODS: Systematic reviews were appraised against Cochrane Collaboration levels of effectiveness. Components of psychosocial interventions were identified with their theoretical rationale. Findings were explored with a Patient, Public and Carer Involvement group. RESULTS: Thirty-six systematic reviews were included. From interventions, 14 components were identified, nine for people with dementia and five for carers, mostly undertaken in nursing/care homes. For people with dementia, there was evidence of effectiveness for cognitive stimulation and cognitive training, but less evidence for sensory stimulation, reminiscence, staff education, behavioural therapy and ADL training. For carers, there was evidence of effectiveness for education and training, psychotherapy and counselling. CONCLUSION: There was a lack of definitive evidence of effectiveness for most psychosocial interventions. Further studies with stronger methodology or replication of existing studies would strengthen the evidence base. Few interventions were undertaken with people with dementia and their carers living at home. Further work will investigate the extent to which components identified here are present in models of home support for people with dementia and carers and their effectiveness.

Parent experiences and information needs related to bronchiolitis: A mixed studies systematic review	"OBJECTIVE: To inform evidence-based knowledge products (i.e., infographics, videos, eBooks) of relevance to parents, we systematically reviewed evidence on parent experiences and information needs related to bronchiolitis. METHODS: We searched Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, and scanned reference lists for studies published post-2000. We appraised quality in duplicate using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) and synthesized findings narratively. RESULTS: We retrieved 797 records and included 29; 14 (48%) met >50% of MMAT criteria. Studies predominantly enrolled mothers. Most reported quantitatively on hospitalization experiences (n = 9, 31%), treatments (n = 5, 17%), or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis (n = 9, 31%). Ten (34%) studies reported on information needs; 3 contributed qualitative data. Parents could not always identify bronchiolitis symptoms. During hospitalization, parents endured guilt and anxiety. Mothers wanted to take an active role in their child's care but often felt uninvolved. Barriers to RSV prophylaxis included transportation, scheduling, and insurance issues. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence focused primarily on hospitalization, which parents found frightening. More information is needed on home care experiences and information preferences. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Timely education and support from healthcare providers may help to alleviate parents' fears and enhance involvement in their child's care. Copyright ¬© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Parent participation in weight-related health interventions for children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis	"OBJECTIVE: To review child and adolescent weight-related health intervention characteristics, with a particular focus on levels of parental participation, and examine differences in intervention effectiveness. METHODS: Multiple social science, health, and medical databases were searched, and experimental randomized controlled studies of child and adolescent weight-related health interventions, reported in January 2004 through December 2010, were collected. Intervention characteristics were reviewed, and pre- and post-measurement data, including body mass index, were extracted for analyses. Differences in effect sizes of experimental and control groups were used to evaluate effectiveness of interventions. RESULTS: Reports of 42 interventions were included. Intervention activities consisted of nutrition education, physical activity education, physical activity sessions, behavior education, behavior therapy, or a combination of these activities. Significant differences existed among levels of parent participation, p<0.05. In addition, intervention duration positively predicted intervention effectiveness, p=0.006, and the linear combination of parent participation and intervention duration significantly predicted intervention effectiveness, p=0.001. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that weight-related health interventions that require parent participation more effectively reduce body mass indexes of child and adolescent participants. In addition, longer interventions that include parent participation appear to have greater success. Suggestions for future research and related interventions are provided.

Parent-Focused Childhood and Adolescent Overweight and Obesity eHealth Interventions: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	"BACKGROUND: Effective broad-reach interventions to reduce childhood obesity are needed, but there is currently little consensus on the most effective approach. Parental involvement in interventions appears to be important. The use of eHealth modalities in interventions also seems to be promising. To our knowledge, there have been no previous reviews that have specifically investigated the effectiveness of parent-focused eHealth obesity interventions, a gap that this systematic review and meta-analysis intends to address. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to review the evidence for body mass index (BMI)/BMI z-score improvements in eHealth overweight and obesity randomized controlled trials for children and adolescents, where parents or carers were an agent of change. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted, which conforms to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Seven databases were searched for the period January 1995 to April 2015. Primary outcome measures were BMI and/or BMI z-score at baseline and post-intervention. Secondary outcomes included diet, physical activity, and screen time. Interventions were included if they targeted parents of children and adolescents aged 0-18 years of age and used an eHealth medium such as the Internet, interactive voice response (IVR), email, social media, telemedicine, or e-learning. RESULTS: Eight studies were included, involving 1487 parent and child or adolescent dyads. A total of 3 studies were obesity prevention trials, and 5 were obesity treatment trials. None of the studies found a statistically significant difference in BMI or BMI z-score between the intervention and control groups at post-intervention, and a meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference in the effects of parent-focused eHealth obesity interventions compared with a control on BMI/BMI z-score (Standardized Mean Difference -0.15, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.16, Z=0.94, P=.35). Four of seven studies that reported on dietary outcomes demonstrated significant improvements in at least 1 dietary measurement, and 1 of 6 studies that reported on physical activity outcomes demonstrated significant improvements compared with the control. The quality of the interventions was generally not high; therefore, these results should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that larger, longer duration, high-quality parent-focused eHealth studies are conducted, which transform successful components from face-to-face interventions into an eHealth format and target younger age groups in particular.

Parent-focused preventive interventions for youth substance use and problem behaviors: A systematic review	"Research indicates substance use initiation increases the risk of other youth problem behaviors and substance dependence. Preventing these problematic behaviors through parenting has the potential for avoiding deleterious consequences for youth, their families, and the community. Purpose: This systematic review provides an assessment of parent-focused preventive interventions that are effective in preventing early substance use (SU) and other problem behaviors among youth. Method: A systematic search following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines was conducted to identify prevention studies. Studies were then assessed utilizing the Society for Prevention Research (SPR) efficacy criteria. Results: Ten studies, utilizing 11 preventive interventions, met all inclusion criteria. Discussion: The efficacious interventions emphasized parent skills training and engagement, were school-based, and utilized multiple prevention strategies. The Strengthening Families Program met the most SPR efficacy criteria. This review suggests parenting interventions are effective at preventing early youth SU and other problem behaviors. Implications for social work practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
Parent-infant psychotherapy for improving parental and infant mental health	"BACKGROUND: Parent-infant psychotherapy (PIP) is a dyadic intervention that works with parent and infant together, with the aim of improving the parent-infant relationship and promoting infant attachment and optimal infant development. PIP aims to achieve this by targeting the mother's view of her infant, which may be affected by her own experiences, and linking them to her current relationship to her child, in order to improve the parent-infant relationship directly. OBJECTIVES: 1. To assess the effectiveness of PIP in improving parental and infant mental health and the parent-infant relationship.2. To identify the programme components that appear to be associated with more effective outcomes and factors that modify intervention effectiveness (e.g. programme duration, programme focus). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases on 13 January 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, BIOSIS Citation Index, Science Citation Index, ERIC, and Sociological Abstracts. We also searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials, checked reference lists, and contacted study authors and other experts. SELECTION CRITERIA: Two review authors assessed study eligibility independently. We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-randomised controlled trials (quasi-RCT) that compared a PIP programme directed at parents with infants aged 24 months or less at study entry, with a control condition (i.e. waiting-list, no treatment or treatment-as-usual), and used at least one standardised measure of parental or infant functioning. We also included studies that only used a second treatment group. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We adhered to the standard methodological procedures of The Cochrane Collaboration. We standardised the treatment effect for each outcome in each study by dividing the mean difference (MD) in post-intervention scores between the intervention and control groups by the pooled standard deviation. We presented standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data, and risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data. We undertook meta-analysis using a random-effects model. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight studies comprising 846 randomised participants, of which four studies involved comparisons of PIP with control groups only. Four studies involved comparisons with another treatment group (i.e. another PIP, video-interaction guidance, psychoeducation, counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), two of these studies included a control group in addition to an alternative treatment group. Samples included women with postpartum depression, anxious or insecure attachment, maltreated, and prison populations. We assessed potential bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, and other bias). Four studies were at low risk of bias in four or more domains. Four studies were at high risk of bias for allocation concealment, and no study blinded participants or personnel to the intervention. Five studies did not provide adequate information for assessment of risk of bias in at least one domain (rated as unclear).Six studies contributed data to the PIP versus control comparisons producing 19 meta-analyses of outcomes measured at post-intervention or follow-up, or both, for the primary outcomes of parental depression (both dichotomous and continuous data); measures of parent-child interaction (i.e. maternal sensitivity, child involvement and parent engagement; infant attachment category (secure, avoidant, disorganised, resistant); attachment change (insecure to secure, stable secure, secure to insecure, stable insecure); infant behaviour and secondary outcomes (e.g. infant cognitive development). The results favoured neither PIP nor control for incidence of parental depression (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.04, 3 studies, 278 participants, low quality evidence) or parent-reported levels of depression (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.02, 4 studies, 356 participants, low quality evidence). There were improvements favouring PIP in the proportion of infants securely attached at post-intervention (RR 8.93, 95% CI 1.25 to 63.70, 2 studies, 168 participants, very low quality evidence); a reduction in the number of infants with an avoidant attachment style at post-intervention (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.95, 2 studies, 168 participants, low quality evidence); fewer infants with disorganised attachment at post-intervention (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.58, 2 studies, 168 participants, low quality evidence); and an increase in the proportion of infants moving from insecure to secure attachment at post-intervention (RR 11.45, 95% CI 3.11 to 42.08, 2 studies, 168 participants, low quality evidence). There were no differences between PIP and control in any of the meta-analyses for the remaining primary outcomes (i.e. adverse effects), or secondary outcomes.Four studies contributed data at post-intervention or follow-up to the PIP versus alternative treatment analyses producing 15 meta-analyses measuring parent mental health (depression); parent-infant interaction (maternal sensitivity); infant attachment category (secure, avoidant, resistant, disorganised) and attachment change (insecure to secure, stable secure, secure to insecure, stable insecure); infant behaviour and infant cognitive development. None of the remaining meta-analyses of PIP versus alternative treatment for primary outcomes (i.e. adverse effects), or secondary outcomes showed differences in outcome or any adverse changes.We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) approach to rate the overall quality of the evidence. For all comparisons, we rated the evidence as low or very low quality for parental depression and secure or disorganised infant attachment. Where we downgraded the evidence, it was because there was risk of bias in the study design or execution of the trial. The included studies also involved relatively few participants and wide CI values (imprecision), and, in some cases, we detected clinical and statistical heterogeneity (inconsistency). Lower quality evidence resulted in lower confidence in the estimate of effect for those outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although the findings of the current review suggest that PIP is a promising model in terms of improving infant attachment security in high-risk families, there were no significant differences compared with no treatment or treatment-as-usual for other parent-based or relationship-based outcomes, and no evidence that PIP is more effective than other methods of working with parents and infants. Further rigorous research is needed to establish the impact of PIP on potentially important mediating factors such as parental mental health, reflective functioning, and parent-infant interaction."
Parent-mediated interventions for promoting communication and language development in young children with Down syndrome	"BACKGROUND: Communication and language development are areas of particular weakness for young children with Down syndrome. Caregivers' interaction with children influences language development, so many early interventions involve training parents how best to respond to their children and provide appropriate language stimulation. Thus, these interventions are mediated through parents, who in turn are trained and coached in the implementation of interventions by clinicians. As the interventions involve a considerable commitment from clinicians and families, we undertook this review to synthesise the evidence of their effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of parent-mediated interventions for improving communication and language development in young children with Down syndrome. Other outcomes are parental behaviour and responsivity, parental stress and satisfaction, and children's non-verbal means of communicating, socialisation and behaviour. SEARCH METHODS: In January 2018 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and 14 other databases. We also searched three trials registers, checked the reference lists of relevant reports identified by the electronic searches, searched the websites of professional organizations, and contacted their staff and other researchers working in the field to identify other relevant published, unpublished and ongoing studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared parent-mediated interventions designed to improve communication and language versus teaching/treatment as usual (TAU) or no treatment or delayed (wait-listed) treatment, in children with Down syndrome aged between birth and six years. We included studies delivering the parent-mediated intervention in conjunction with a clinician-mediated intervention, as long as the intervention group was the only group to receive the former and both groups received the latter. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures for data collection and analysis. MAIN RESULTS: We included three studies involving 45 children aged between 29 months and six years with Down syndrome. Two studies compared parent-mediated interventions versus TAU; the third compared a parent-mediated plus clinician-mediated intervention versus a clinician-mediated intervention alone. Treatment duration varied from 12 weeks to six months. One study provided nine group sessions and four individualised home-based sessions over a 13-week period. Another study provided weekly, individual clinic-based or home-based sessions lasting 1.5 to 2 hours, over a six-month period. The third study provided one 2- to 3-hour group session followed by bi-weekly, individual clinic-based sessions plus once-weekly home-based sessions for 12 weeks. Because of the different study designs and outcome measures used, we were unable to conduct a meta-analysis.We judged all three studies to be at high risk of bias in relation to blinding of participants (not possible due to the nature of the intervention) and blinding of outcome assessors, and at an unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment. We judged one study to be at unclear risk of selection bias, as authors did not report the methods used to generate the random sequence; at high risk of reporting bias, as they did not report on one assessed outcome; and at high risk of detection bias, as the control group had a cointervention and only parents in the intervention group were made aware of the target words for their children. The sample sizes of each included study were very small, meaning that they are unlikely to be representative of the target population.The findings from the three included studies were inconsistent. Two studies found no differences in expressive or receptive language abilities between the groups, whether measured by direct assessment or parent reports. However, they did find that children in the intervention group could use more targeted vocabulary items or utterances with language targets in certain contexts postintervention, compared to those in the control group; this was not maintained 12 months later. The third study found gains for the intervention group on total-language measures immediately postintervention.One study did not find any differences in parental stress scores between the groups at any time point up to 12 months postintervention. All three studies noted differences in most measures of how the parents talked to and interacted with their children postintervention, and in one study most strategies were maintained in the intervention group at 12 months postintervention. No study reported evidence of language attrition following the intervention in either group, while one study found positive outcomes on children's socialisation skills in the intervention group. One study looked at adherence to the treatment through attendance data, finding that mothers in the intervention group attended seven out of nine group sessions and were present for four home visits. No study measured parental use of the strategies outside of the intervention sessions.A grant from the Hospital for Sick Children Foundation (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) funded one study. Another received partial funding from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Department of Education in the USA. The remaining study did not specify any funding sources.In light of the serious limitations in methodology, and the small number of studies included, we considered the overall quality of the evidence, as assessed by GRADE, to be very low. This means that we have very little confidence in the results, and further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of treatment effect. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effects of parent-mediated interventions for improving the language and communication of children with Down syndrome. We found only three small studies of very low quality. This review highlights the need for well-designed studies, including RCTs, to evaluate the effectiveness of parent-mediated interventions. Trials should use valid, reliable and similar measures of language development, and they should include measures of secondary outcomes more distal to the intervention, such as family well-being. Treatment fidelity, in particular parental dosage of the intervention outside of prescribed sessions, also needs to be documented."
Parent-only interventions for childhood overweight or obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years	"BACKGROUND: Child and adolescent overweight and obesity have increased globally, and are associated with short- and long-term health consequences. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions delivered to parents only for the treatment of overweight and obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years. SEARCH METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of databases including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS as well trial registers. We checked references of identified trials and systematic reviews. We applied no language restrictions. The date of the last search was March 2015 for all databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions delivered to parents only for treating overweight or obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for risk of bias and evaluated overall study quality using the GRADE instrument. Where necessary, we contacted authors for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: We included 20 RCTs, including 3057 participants. The number of participants ranged per trial between 15 and 645. Follow-up ranged between 24 weeks and two years. Eighteen trials were parallel RCTs and two were cluster RCTs. Twelve RCTs had two comparisons and eight RCTs had three comparisons. The interventions varied widely; the duration, content, delivery and follow-up of the interventions were heterogeneous. The comparators also differed. This review categorised the comparisons into four groups: parent-only versus parent-child, parent-only versus waiting list controls, parent-only versus minimal contact interventions and parent-only versus other parent-only interventions.Trial quality was generally low with a large proportion of trials rated as high risk of bias on individual risk of bias criteria.In trials comparing a parent-only intervention with a parent-child intervention, the body mass index (BMI) z score change showed a mean difference (MD) at the longest follow-up period (10 to 24 months) of -0.04 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.15 to 0.08); P = 0.56; 267 participants; 3 trials; low quality evidence. In trials comparing a parent-only intervention with a waiting list control, the BMI z score change in favour of the parent-only intervention at the longest follow-up period (10-12 months) had an MD of -0.10 (95% CI -0.19 to -0.01); P = 0.04; 136 participants; 2 trials; low quality evidence. BMI z score change of parent-only interventions when compared with minimal contact control interventions at the longest follow-up period (9 to 12 months) showed an MD of 0.01 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.09); P = 0.81; 165 participants; 1 trial; low quality evidence. There were few similarities between interventions and comparators across the included trials in the parent-only intervention versus other parent-only interventions and we did not pool these data. Generally, these trials did not show substantial differences between their respective parent-only groups on BMI outcomes.Other outcomes such as behavioural measures, parent-child relationships and health-related quality of life were reported inconsistently. Adverse effects of the interventions were generally not reported, two trials stated that there were no serious adverse effects. No trials reported on all-cause mortality, morbidity or socioeconomic effects.All results need to be interpreted cautiously because of their low quality, the heterogeneous interventions and comparators, and the high rates of non-completion. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Parent-only interventions may be an effective treatment option for overweight or obese children aged 5 to 11 years when compared with waiting list controls. Parent-only interventions had similar effects compared with parent-child interventions and compared with those with minimal contact controls. However, the evidence is at present limited; some of the trials had a high risk of bias with loss to follow-up being a particular issue and there was a lack of evidence for several important outcomes. The systematic review has identified 10 ongoing trials that have a parent-only arm, which will contribute to future updates. These trials will improve the robustness of the analyses by type of comparator, and may permit subgroup analysis by intervention component and the setting. Trial reports should provide adequate details about the interventions to be replicated by others. There is a need to conduct and report cost-effectiveness analyses in future trials in order to establish whether parent-only interventions are more cost-effective than parent-child interventions."
Parental Cognitions and Motivation to Engage in Psychological Interventions: A Systematic Review	"This paper reviews the available research on the predictors of parental engagement in preventive and therapeutic psychological interventions that target mental health problems in children. Based on previous literature, seven predictors concerning parental motivation to engage are considered: perceived child problems, perceived parenting, attributions of problems, self-efficacy, expectations about treatment, perceived obstacles and global motivation to engage. PRISMA guidelines for systematic review were used to conduct the literature search. Thirty-seven studies that examined prospective relations between parental cognitions evaluated at the beginning of the intervention and parental engagement during the intervention were included. Most studies focused on the parents' perception of the child's problems and of parenting, with fewer studies examining the role of the other parental cognitions. The results suggest that the psychological dimensions proposed in motivational models may play an important role in understanding parental engagement in preventive and therapeutic psychological interventions."
Parental decision making for children with cancer at the end of life: a meta-ethnography	"Parents of pediatric oncology patients are faced with difficult decisions when their child reaches the end of life. For health care providers to provide optimal care, they must understand parents' perspectives and preferences in end-of-life decision making. Therefore, this article provides a systematic review of the literature on the end-of-life decision making of parents of children with cancer as well as recommendations for practice and future research. Parents participated in surveys, focus groups, participant observation, and interviews to help researchers understand the expectations, hopes, fears, and values that guide their decision making. Common themes were patient-provider communication, extending time, and understanding prognosis."
Parental disclosure of assisted reproductive technology (ART) conception to their children: a systematic and meta-analytic review	"STUDY QUESTION: Does a genetic link and/or a child's age influence a parent's willingness to talk to a child about how they were conceived? SUMMARY ANSWER: The presence/absence of a biological link and the child's age clearly influences the disclosure process. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The research published to date has yielded diverse findings on autologous and donor assisted reproductive technology (ART) parents' disclosure of the conception method to their children and on the ages at which the children are informed, if told. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out. A search of MEDLINE and PUBMED was run for English-language studies published from January 1996 through January 2015. A total of 26 studies were included in the systematic review, 19 of which were included in the meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: A total of 2814 parent responses were included in the systematic review. Two authors independently assessed the studies for review inclusion. Selection criteria were: peer-reviewed studies, quantitative studies only, research conducted after the birth of ART-conceived children, number of parent responses on disclosure status reported in terms of Told, Plan to tell, Uncertain, Plan to not tell. Thirty-two (32) study-level effect size statistics were included in the meta-analysis. Three authors independently assessed the risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Among parents who responded, 23% of the total number of parent responses indicated that they had already Told; 44% were Planning to tell; 13% were Uncertain and 20% were Planning to not tell their children about their ART conception. Meta-analysis gave no statistically significant differences between autologous and donor ART in the =10 years old), a statistically significant difference was observed for autologous ART (Cohen's h = 0.86): Planning to tell showed a higher probability in the 10 years age group for the autologous ART subsample, than in the donor ART subsample (Cohen's h = 0.89). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: All parents participated voluntarily in the studies and may have influenced the data in the direction of disclosure thereby. The reviewed studies, moreover, differed in terms of methodology, type of sample and data categorization method. The number of studies analyzing disclosure for children >=10 years was quite limited; and lastly, most of the data examined were not collected longitudinally. IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The high number of non-disclosing parents treated by donor ART points to an underestimation of the medical risks for the offspring (the presence of genetic illnesses, inadvertent consanguinity) and suggests that these children's rights may not be given due consideration. The decision to disclose may become more difficult over time, and ART parents need greater psychological support throughout the process. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: The study was funded by the University of Trieste. Copyright ¬© The Author 2016.

Parenting experiences of living with a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review of qualitative evidence	"BACKGROUND: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is the most prevalent mental disorder among children and adolescents worldwide. Parenting a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is challenging and parents find it difficult to raise the child and struggle to get professional support. Research has shown how living with a child with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder influences the families' daily life. This includes how the parents manage to maintain a bearable family life, supportive or not supportive factors as well as parents' experiences of collaboration with professionals in diverse settings. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to identify and synthesize the best available evidence on parenting experiences of living with a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, including their experiences of health care and other services. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review considered research articles with qualitative data examining the experiences of parents of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The phenomena of interest were parenting experiences of living with a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, including their experiences of health care and other services, and collaboration with professionals. SEARCH STRATEGY: Retrospective and prospective searches were conducted in MedNar, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL. The reference lists of the included research articles were searched for additional studies, and a search for cited citations in Web of Science was conducted. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Two independent reviewers assessed articles selected for retrieval for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using the standardized critical appraisal instrument from the Joanna Briggs Institute, the Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted from research articles included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from the Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. DATA SYNTHESIS: Qualitative research findings were pooled using the Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. This involved aggregation and synthesis of findings. RESULTS: A total of 21 research articles were included in the review. The review process resulted in 129 study findings that were aggregated into 15 categories. The categories generated six synthesized findings: 1) An emotional roller coaster between hope and hopelessness, 2) Mothers as advocates in a battlefield within the system and family, 3) Parental experiences in a crossfire of blame, self-blame and stigmatization, 4) Shuttling between supportive and non-supportive services and professionals, 5) Routines, structures and strategies within everyday life, and 6) Despite multiple challenges, it is not all bad. CONCLUSIONS: The findings illustrate the complexity of parental experiences that are influenced by guilt, hope, blame, stigmatization, exhaustion, reconciliation and professional collaboration. The findings address the impact attention deficit hyperactivity disorder has on the everyday family, and how parents seem to adapt to their life situation in the process of accepting their child's disorder. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Health care systems and other professionals need to provide support and understanding to families of children with ADHD. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Further research is needed to examine how professionals in health care settings can address the individual needs of the families and how future interventions may support the families and improve competences of health professionals."
Parenting interventions for the prevention of unintentional injuries in childhood	"BACKGROUND: Parent education and training programmes can improve maternal psychosocial health, child behavioural problems and parenting practices. This review assesses the effects of parenting interventions for reducing child injury. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of parenting interventions for preventing unintentional injury in children aged under 18 years and for increasing possession and use of safety equipment and safety practices by parents. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS Preview, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, Social Science Citation Index, CINAHL, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, ERIC, DARE, ASSIA, Web of Science, SIGLE and ZETOC. We also handsearched abstracts from the World Conferences on Injury Prevention & Control and the journal Injury Prevention. The searches were conducted in January 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (non-RCTs) and controlled before and after studies (CBAs), which evaluated parenting interventions administered to parents of children aged 18 years and under, and reported outcome data on injuries for children (unintentional or unspecified intent), possession and use of safety equipment or safety practices (including the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) scale which contained an assessment of home safety) by parents. Parenting interventions were defined as those with a specified protocol, manual or curriculum aimed at changing knowledge, attitudes or skills covering a range of parenting topics. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Studies were selected, data were extracted and quality appraised independently by two authors. Pooled relative risks (RR) were estimated using random effect models. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty two studies were included in the review: 16 RCTs, two non-RCTs, one partially randomised trial which contained two randomised intervention arms and one non-randomised control arm, two CBA studies and one quasi randomised controlled trial. Seventeen studies provided interventions comprising parenting education and other support services; 15 of which were home visiting programmes and two of which were paediatric practice-based interventions. Two provided solely educational interventions. Nineteen studies recruited families who were from socio-economically disadvantaged populations, were at risk of adverse child outcomes or people who may benefit from extra support, such as single mothers, teenage mothers, first time mothers and mothers with learning difficulties. Ten RCTs involving 5074 participants were included in the meta-analysis, which indicated that intervention families had a statistically significant lower risk of injury than control families (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.94). Sensitivity analyses undertaken including only RCTs at low risk of various sources of bias found the findings to be robust to including only those studies at low risk of detection bias in terms of blinded outcome assessment and attrition bias in terms of follow up of fewer than 80% of participants in each arm. When analyses were restricted to studies at low risk of selection bias in terms of inadequate allocation concealment the effect size was no longer statistically significant. Several studies found statistically significant fewer home hazards or a greater number of safety practices in intervention families. Of ten studies reporting scores on the HOME scale, data from three RCTs were included in a meta-analysis which found no evidence of a difference in quality of the home environment between treatment arms (mean difference 0.57, 95% CI -0.59 to 1.72). Most of the studies reporting home safety practices, home hazards or composite home safety scores found statistically significant effects favouring intervention arm families. Overall, using GRADE, the quality of the evidence was rated as moderate. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Parenting interventions, most commonly provided within the home using multi-faceted interventions are effective in reducing child injury. There is fairly consistent evidence that they also improve home safety. The evidence relates mainly to interventions provided to families from disadvantaged populations, who are at risk of adverse child health outcomes or whose families may benefit from extra support. Further research is required to explore mechanisms by which these interventions may reduce injury, the features of parenting interventions that are necessary or sufficient to reduce injury and the generalisability to different population groups."
Parents Suggest Which Indicators of Progress and Outcomes Should be Measured in Young Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.	"Evaluation of interventions for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is hampered by the multitude of outcomes measured and tools used. Measurement in research with young children tends to focus on core impairments in ASD. We conducted a systematic review of qualitative studies of what matters to parents. Parent advisory groups completed structured activities to explore their perceptions of the relative importance of a wide range of outcome constructs. Their highest ranked outcomes impacted directly on everyday life and functioning (anxiety, distress, hypersensitivity, sleep problems, happiness, relationships with brothers and sisters, and parent stress). Collaboration between professionals, researchers and parents/carers is required to determine an agreed core set of outcomes to use across evaluation research."
Parents' and informal caregivers' views and experiences of communication about routine childhood vaccination: a synthesis of qualitative evidence	"BACKGROUND: Childhood vaccination is an effective way to prevent serious childhood illnesses, but many children do not receive all the recommended vaccines. There are various reasons for this; some parents lack access because of poor quality health services, long distances or lack of money. Other parents may not trust vaccines or the healthcare workers who provide them, or they may not see the need for vaccination due to a lack of information or misinformation about how vaccinations work and the diseases they can prevent.Communication with parents about childhood vaccinations is one way of addressing these issues. Communication can take place at healthcare facilities, at home or in the community. Communication can be two-way, for example face-to-face discussions between parents and healthcare providers, or one-way, for instance via text messages, posters or radio programmes. Some types of communication enable parents to actively discuss vaccines and their benefits and harms, as well as diseases they can prevent. Other communication types simply give information about vaccination issues or when and where vaccines are available. People involved in vaccine programmes need to understand how parents experience different types of communication about vaccination and how this influences their decision to vaccinate. OBJECTIVES: The specific objectives of the review were to identify, appraise and synthesise qualitative studies exploring: parents' and informal caregivers' views and experiences regarding communication about childhood vaccinations and the manner in which it is communicated; and the influence that vaccination communication has on parents' and informal caregivers' decisions regarding childhood vaccination. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), MEDLINE In-process and Other Non-Index Citations (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (EbscoHOST), and Anthropology Plus (EbscoHost) databases for eligible studies from inception to 30 August 2016. We developed search strategies for each database, using guidelines developed by the Cochrane Qualitative Research Methods Group for searching for qualitative evidence as well as modified versions of the search developed for three related reviews of effectiveness. There were no date or geographic restrictions for the search. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies that utilised qualitative methods for data collection and analysis; focused on the views and experiences of parents and informal caregivers regarding information about vaccination for children aged up to six years; and were from any setting globally where information about childhood vaccinations was communicated or distributed. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used maximum variation purposive sampling for data synthesis, using a three-step sampling frame. We conducted a thematic analysis using a constant comparison strategy for data extraction and synthesis. We assessed our confidence in the findings using the GRADE-CERQual approach. High confidence suggests that it is highly likely that the review finding is a reasonable representation of the phenomenon of interest, while very low confidence indicates that it is not clear whether the review finding is a reasonable representation of it. Using a matrix model, we then integrated our findings with those from other Cochrane reviews that assessed the effects of different communication strategies on parents' knowledge, attitudes and behaviour about childhood vaccination. MAIN RESULTS: We included 38 studies, mostly from high-income countries, many of which explored mothers' perceptions of vaccine communication. Some focused on the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine.In general, parents wanted more information than they were getting (high confidence in the evidence). Lack of information led to worry and regret about vaccination decisions among some parents (moderate confidence).Parents wanted balanced information about vaccination benefits and harms (high confidence), presented clearly and simply (moderate confidence) and tailored to their situation (low confidence in the evidence). Parents wanted vaccination information to be available at a wider variety of locations, including outside health services (low confidence) and in good time before each vaccination appointment (moderate confidence).Parents viewed health workers as an important source of information and had specific expectations of their interactions with them (high confidence). Poor communication and negative relationships with health workers sometimes impacted on vaccination decisions (moderate confidence).Parents generally found it difficult to know which vaccination information source to trust and challenging to find information they felt was unbiased and balanced (high confidence).The amount of information parents wanted and the sources they felt could be trusted appeared to be linked to acceptance of vaccination, with parents who were more hesitant wanting more information (low to moderate confidence).Our synthesis and comparison of the qualitative evidence shows that most of the trial interventions addressed at least one or two key aspects of communication, including the provision of information prior to the vaccination appointment and tailoring information to parents' needs. None of the interventions appeared to respond to negative media stories or address parental perceptions of health worker motives. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We have high or moderate confidence in the evidence contributing to several review findings. Further research, especially in rural and low- to middle-income country settings, could strengthen evidence for the findings where we had low or very low confidence. Planners should consider the timing for making vaccination information available to parents, the settings where information is available, the provision of impartial and clear information tailored to parental needs, and parents' perceptions of health workers and the information provided."
Parents' and nurses' experiences of partnership in neonatal intensive care units: a qualitative review and meta-synthesis	"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore how parents and nurses experience partnership in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and to identify existing barriers and facilitators to a successful partnership. BACKGROUND: Family-centered care (FCC) is recommended as a frame of reference for treatment and care in NICUs. A key element in FCC is partnership. Such partnerships are characterised by complex interpersonal relationships and interactions between nurses and parents/families. Partnerships therefore appear to present a significant challenge. DESIGN: A qualitative review and meta-synthesis. METHODS: Comprehensive searching in ten databases: Cinahl, Pubmed (MEDLINE), Embase, PsycInfo, Scopus and Swemed+, Opengrey, MedNar, Google Scholar and ProQuest Dissertations & Thesis Global. A total of 1,644 studies (after removal of duplicates) were critically assessed and 21 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A meta-aggregation was used to synthesise the findings from the studies. Methodically quality assessed with QUARI/SUMARI and PRISMA. FINDINGS: Through a meta-aggregative approach two synthesised findings were developed: 1) co-creation of mutual knowledge and 2) developing competencies and negotiating roles. The first synthesis embraced the categories: being respected and listened to, trust, sharing knowledge, and the second synthesis embraced the categories: space to learn with guidance, encouraging and enabling, being in control. In constructing the categories, findings were identified as characteristics, barriers and facilitators to application. CONCLUSION: A successful relationship between parents and nurses can be achieved through co-creation of mutual knowledge as well as development of competencies and negotiation of roles. Neonatal Intensive Care Unit nurses are in a position where they exercise power, but they can change the culture if they are aware of what seems to facilitate or create a barrier to a partnership with parents. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This new evidence may inform a change in policies and guidelines which could be integrated into nurses' clinical practice in NICUs.

"Parents' voices: ""Our process of advocating for our child with autism."" A meta-synthesis of parents' perspectives"	"BACKGROUND: Advocacy has been described by parents of children with autism as an important coping strategy, enabling them to move forward by redirecting emotions into actions. A key factor in the development of collaborative and constructive partnerships between service providers and parents is having an understanding of how parents engage in advocacy and the support needed to do so. This meta-synthesis was undertaken to consolidate in-depth qualitative data from parents' perspectives of the process that they use to advocate for their children with autism. METHODS: A qualitative meta-synthesis was conducted, whereby 15 databases were systematically searched. Thirty-one studies were identified and appraised using an adapted version of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. Data were synthesized into themes through the steps of review, meta-aggregation, integration, and interpretation. RESULTS: The voices of 1,662 parents are presented describing the process of advocacy in the stages of seeking a diagnosis, seeking self-education, and taking action. Taking action includes 2 subthemes: seeking, access, and use of support services and community engagement and educating others. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the significant impact that positive experiences with first-line professionals have during the diagnosis process and how these experiences lay the foundation for all future relationships with other service providers. Important implications arise from this meta-synthesis for service providers in supporting parents' advocacy and hence building constructive relationships with families with a child with autism.

"Parents"" experiences of neonatal transfer. A meta-study of qualitative research 2000Äì2017"	"Transfers of critically ill neonates are frequent phenomena. Even though parents"" participation is regarded as crucial in neonatal care, a transfer often means that parents and neonates are separated. A systematic review of the parents"" experiences of neonatal transfer is lacking. This paper describes a meta-study addressing qualitative research about parents"" experiences of neonatal transfer. Through deconstruction and reflections of theories, methods, and empirical data, the aim was to achieve a deeper understanding of theoretical, empirical, contextual, historical, and methodological issues of qualitative studies concerning parents"" experiences of neonatal transfer over the course of this meta-study (2000Äì2017). Meta-theory and meta-method analyses showed that caring, transition, and family-centered care were main theoretical frames applied and that interviewing with a small number of participants was the preferred data collection method. The meta-data-analysis showed that transfer was a scary, unfamiliar, and threatening experience for the parents; they were losing familiar context, were separated from their neonate, and could feel their parenthood disrupted. We identified Äòwavering and wandering"" as a metaphoric representation of the parents"" experiences. The findings add knowledge about meta-study as an approach for comprehensive qualitative research and point at the value of meta-theory and meta-method analyses."
"Parents"" Perspectives on Inclusive Schools for Children with Autism Spectrum Conditions"	NA
Participant views and experiences of participating in HIV research in sub-Saharan Africa: a qualitative systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus clinical trials are increasingly being conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. There is a tension between the pressure to increase levels of research participation and the need to ensure informed consent and protection of participants' rights. Researchers need to be aware of the particular ethical issues that underpin Human immunodeficiency virus research conduct in low income settings. This necessitates hearing from those who have participated in research and who have direct experience of the research process. OBJECTIVES: This review aimed to synthesize and present the best available evidence in relation to Human immunodeficiency virus research participation in sub-Saharan Africa, based on the views and experiences of research participants. INCLUSION CRITERIA: TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: The review included studies whose participants were current or former adult Human immunodeficiency virus research participants from sub-Saharan African countries. PHENOMENON OF INTEREST: Views, experiences, attitudes, understandings, perceptions and perspectives of Human immunodeficiency virus research participants in sub-Saharan Africa. Types of studies: This review considered studies that focused on qualitative data, including, but not limited to, designs such as phenomenology, ethnography, grounded theory, action research and feminist research. SEARCH STRATEGY: A three-step search strategy was utilized. Seven databases (CINAHL, Ovid MEDLINE (R) 1946, ASSIA, PsychInfo, Web of Science, EMBASE, and African Index Medicus) were searched with no limitation to years of publication, followed by hand searching of reference lists. Only studies published in the English language were considered. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Methodological quality was assessed using the Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA EXTRACTION: Qualitative findings were extracted using the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. DATA SYNTHESIS: Qualitative research findings were pooled using a pragmatic meta-aggregative approach and the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument software. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in the review. One hundred and thirty-six findings were extracted from included studies and clustered into 14 categories based on similarities in meaning. These were further synthesized into five synthesized findings, set out below; i) Individuals are motivated to participate in Human immunodeficiency virus research due to a range of perceived benefits for themselves and others. ii) Participation in research can be associated with considerable fear and uncertainty. iii) Participation in Human immunodeficiency virus research is strongly influenced by social relationships (e.g. support or disapproval of family or friends) and social-economic and domestic factors (such as time or finances). iv). The meanings of research programs and processes are constructed within a context of existing lay beliefs, experiences and social relations associated with Human immunodeficiency virus and biomedical interventions in general. This means that local people may understand research and its processes very differently to health professionals. v) Participants' research experiences and their continued participation in Human immunodeficiency virus research are influenced by the research clinic context and the nature of their interactions with research staff. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals are generally willing to participate in Human immunodeficiency virus research. However their understanding of the process can be limited, and the experience may may cause anxiety or have negative consequences. Furthermore longer-term participation may become problematic due to socio-economic pressure or social commitments. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The review suggests a need to develop better ways to explain research processes and to support participants, when/if they encounter problems. There is also a need to engage better with communities in order to educate them about HIV research programs. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: All the included studies focused on experiences around research enrolment and participation (retention); however there is a complete evidence gap on experiences of trial closure.

Participation and outcome in manualized self-help for bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder - a systematic review and metaregression analysis	"There is a growing body of research on manualized self-help interventions for bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED). Study and treatment dropout and adherence represent particular challenges in these studies. However, systematic investigations of the relationship between study, intervention and patient characteristics, participation, and intervention outcomes are lacking. We conducted a systematic literature review using electronic databases and hand searches of relevant journals. In metaregression analyses, we analyzed study dropout as well as more specific measures of treatment participation in manualized self-help interventions, their association with intervention characteristics (e.g. duration, guidance, intervention type bibliotherapy, CD-ROM or Internet based intervention]) and their association with treatment outcomes. Seventy-three publications reporting on 50 different trials of manualized self-help interventions for binge eating and bulimia nervosa published through July 9th 2012 were identified. Across studies, dropout rates ranged from 1% to 88%. Study dropout rates were highest in CD-ROM interventions and lowest in Internet-based interventions. They were higher in samples of BN patients, samples of patients with higher degrees of dietary restraint at baseline, lower age, and lower body mass index. Between 6% and 88% of patients completed the intervention to which they had been assigned. None of the patient, study and intervention characteristics predicted intervention completion rates. Intervention outcomes were moderated by the provision of personal guidance by a health professional, the number of guidance sessions as well as participants' age, BMI, and eating disorder related attitudes (Restraint, Eating, Weight and Shape Concerns) at baseline (after adjusting for study dropout and intervention completion rates). Guidance particularly improved adherence and outcomes in samples of patients with bulimia nervosa; specialist guidance led to higher intervention completion rates and larger intervention effects on some outcomes than non-specialist guidance. Self-help interventions have a place in the treatment of BN and BED, especially if the features of their delivery and indications are considered carefully. To better determine who benefits most from what kind and ""dosage"" of self-help interventions, we recommend the use of consistent terminology as well as uniform standards for reporting adherence and participation in future self-help trials.

Participation in mental healthcare: a qualitative meta-synthesis	"Background: Facilitation of service user participation in the co-production of mental healthcare planning and service delivery is an integral component of contemporary mental health policy and clinical guidelines. However, many service users continue to experience exclusion from the planning of their care. This review synthesizes qualitative research about participation in mental healthcare and articulates essential processes that enable service user participation in mental health care. Methods: Electronic databases were systematically searched. Studies were included if they were peer reviewed qualitative studies, published between 2000 and 2015, examining participation in mental health care. The Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist was used to assess the quality of each included study. Constant comparison was used to identify similar constructs across several studies, which were then abstracted into thematic constructs. Results: The synthesis resulted in the identification of six principal themes, which articulate key processes that facilitate service user participation in mental healthcare. These themes included: exercising influence; tokenism; sharing knowledge; lacking capacity; respect; and empathy. Conclusions: This meta-synthesis demonstrates that service user participation in mental healthcare remains a policy aspiration, which generally has not been translated into clinical practice. The continued lack of impact on policy on the delivery of mental healthcare suggests that change may have to be community driven. Systemic service user advocacy groups could contribute critically to promoting authentic service user participation in the co-production of mental health services."
Participation in psychosocial oncology and quality-of-life research: a systematic review	"Quality-of-life and psychosocial oncology studies that have low participation might have less precision, less statistical power, and can have non-response bias. In this systematic Review, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycInfo, for paediatric studies published in 2010-15 and adults studies published 2014-15. Studies were eligible if they were original studies published in a peer-reviewed journal; recruited children (aged 0-18 years at diagnosis) with cancer or their parents, or adult patients with cancer; and assessed psychosocial outcomes, including quality of life, depression, anxiety, wellbeing, distress, coping, or adjustment as a primary or secondary outcome. We assessed participation reporting quality, calculated percentages of participation achieved, and measured the influence of study design and participant characteristics. We reviewed 311 studies including a total of 87 240 adults, children, and parents. Mean participation across studies was more than 70% (paediatric participation was 72% and adult participation was 74%). Many studies did not report data essential for the assessment of participation, especially for non-respondents. Studies using a longitudinal cohort design had higher participation than randomised trials. In paediatric studies, recruitment of participants at diagnosis, face to face, and with the use of short questionnaires yielded higher participation. Other study design characteristics (method of data collection, who enrolled the participants, and incentives) and patient characteristics (cancer type, patient or parent age, and sex) did not affect participation in either paediatric or adult studies. Researchers can use these data to improve reporting quality and make evidence-based choices to maximise participation in future studies. Copyright ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Participation levels of physical activity programs for community-dwelling older adults: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Although many physical activity (PA) programs have been implemented and tested for effectiveness, high participation levels are needed in order to achieve public health impact. This study aimed to determine participation levels of PA programs aimed to improve PA among community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: We searched five databases up until March 2013 (PubMed, PubMed publisher, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science) to identify English-written studies investigating the effect of PA programs on at least one component of PA (e.g. frequency, duration) among community-dwelling populations (i.e. not in a primary care setting and/or assisted living or nursing home) of persons aged 55 years and older. Proportions of participants starting and completing the PA programs (initial and sustained participation, respectively) were determined. RESULTS: The search strategy yielded 11,994 records of which 16 studies were included reporting on 17 PA programs. The number of participants enrolled in the PA programs ranged between 24 and 582 persons. For 12 PA programs it was not possible to calculate initial participation because the number of older adults invited to participate was unknown due to convenience sampling. Of the five remaining programs, mean initial participation level was 9.2% (+/-5.7%). Mean sustained participation level of all 17 programs was 79.8% (+/-13.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Understanding how to optimize initial participation of older adults in PA programs deserves more attention in order to improve the population impact of PA programs for community-dwelling older adults."
Participative mental health consumer research for improving physical health care: An integrative review	"People with mental illness have a significantly lower life expectancy and higher rates of chronic physical illnesses than the general population. Health care system reform to improve access and quality is greatly needed to address this inequity. The inclusion of consumers of mental health services as co-investigators in research is likely to enhance service reform. In light of this, the current paper reviews mental health consumer focussed research conducted to date, addressing the neglect of physical health in mental health care and initiatives with the aim of improving physical health care. The international literature on physical healthcare in the context of mental health services was searched for articles, including mental health consumers in research roles, via Medline, CINAHL and Google Scholar, in October 2015. Four studies where mental health consumers participated as researchers were identified. Three studies involved qualitative research on barriers and facilitators to physical health care access, and a fourth study on developing technologies for more effective communication between GPs and patients. This review found that participatory mental health consumer research in physical health care reform has only become visible in the academic literature in 2015. Heightened consideration of mental health consumer participation in research is required by health care providers and researchers. Mental health nurses can provide leadership in increasing mental health consumer research on integrated care directed towards reducing the health gap between people with and without mental illness."
Participatory epidemiology: the contribution of participatory research to epidemiology	"BACKGROUND: Epidemiology has contributed in many ways to identifying various risk factors for disease and to promoting population health. However, there is a continuing debate about the ability of epidemiology not only to describe, but also to provide results which can be better translated into public health practice. It has been proposed that participatory research approaches be applied to epidemiology as a way to bridge this gap between description and action. A systematic account of what constitutes participatory epidemiology practice has, however, been lacking. METHODS: A scoping review was carried out focused on the question of what constitutes participatory approaches to epidemiology for the purpose of demonstrating their potential for advancing epidemiologic research. Relevant databases were searched, including both the published and non-published (grey) literature. The 102 identified sources were analyzed in terms of comparing common epidemiologic approaches to participatory counterparts regarding central aspects of the research process. Exemplary studies applying participatory approaches were examined more closely. RESULTS: A highly diverse, interdisciplinary body of literature was synthesized, resulting in a framework comprised of seven aspects of the research process: research goal, research question, population, context, data synthesis, research management, and dissemination of findings. The framework specifies how participatory approaches not only differ from, but also how they can enhance common approaches in epidemiology. Finally, recommendations for the further development of participatory approaches are given. These include: enhancing data collection, data analysis, and data validation; advancing capacity building for research at the local level; and developing data synthesis. CONCLUSION: The proposed framework provides a basis for systematically developing the emergent science of participatory epidemiology."
Participatory methods in pediatric participatory research: a systematic review	"Meaningful child participation in medical research is seen as important. In order to facilitate further development of participatory research, we performed a systematic literature study to describe and assess the available knowledge on participatory methods in pediatric research. A search was executed in five databases: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Cochrane. After careful screening of relevant papers, finally 24 documents were included in our analysis. Literature on participatory methods in pediatric research appears generally to be descriptive, whereby high-quality evidence is lacking. Overall, five groups of participatory methods for children could be distinguished: observational, verbal, written, visual, and active methods. The choice for one of these methods should be based on the child's age, on social and demographic characteristics, and on the research objectives. To date, these methods are still solely used for obtaining data, yet they are suitable for conducting meaningful participation. This may result in a successful partnership between children and researchers. Researchers conducting participatory research with children can use this systematic review in order to weigh the current knowledge about the participatory methods presented."
Participatory Research as One Piece of the Puzzle: A Systematic Review of Consumer Involvement in Design of Technology-Based Youth Mental Health and Well-Being Interventions.	"BACKGROUND: Despite the potential of technology-based mental health interventions for young people, limited uptake and/or adherence is a significant challenge. It is thought that involving young people in the development and delivery of services designed for them leads to better engagement. Further research is required to understand the role of participatory approaches in design of technology-based mental health and well-being interventions for youth. OBJECTIVE: To investigate consumer involvement processes and associated outcomes from studies using participatory methods in development of technology-based mental health and well-being interventions for youth. METHODS: Fifteen electronic databases, using both resource-specific subject headings and text words, were searched describing 2 broad concepts-participatory research and mental health/illness. Grey literature was accessed via Google Advanced search, and relevant conference Web sites and reference lists were also searched. A first screening of titles/abstracts eliminated irrelevant citations and documents. The remaining citations were screened by a second reviewer. Full text articles were double screened. All projects employing participatory research processes in development and/or design of (ICT/digital) technology-based youth mental health and well-being interventions were included. No date restrictions were applied; English language only. Data on consumer involvement, research and design process, and outcomes were extracted via framework analysis. RESULTS: A total of 6210 studies were reviewed, 38 full articles retrieved, and 17 included in this study. It was found that consumer participation was predominantly consultative and consumerist in nature and involved design specification and intervention development, and usability/pilot testing. Sustainable participation was difficult to achieve. Projects reported clear dichotomies around designer/researcher and consumer assumptions of effective and acceptable interventions. It was not possible to determine the impact of participatory research on intervention effectiveness due to lack of outcome data. Planning for or having pre-existing implementation sites assisted implementation. The review also revealed a lack of theory-based design and process evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Consumer consultations helped shape intervention design. However, with little evidence of outcomes and a lack of implementation following piloting, the value of participatory research remains unclear."
"Partnering with insiders: A review of peer models across community-engaged research, education and social care."	"Within community-engaged research, education and social care, peer models that partner with local ""insiders"" are increasingly common. Peer models are composed of insider ""lay"" community members who often share similarities or background with a project's target population. Peers are not academically trained, but work alongside researchers and professionals to carry out specific tasks within a project, or in the truest sense of partnership, peers collaborate throughout the project from start to finish as an equal member of the team. Although peer models are used widely, the literature lacks consistency and clarity. This systematic review of literature used a qualitative thematic synthesis to examine and report how, where and why peer models have been used in research, education and social care. We examined the language and titles used to describe the peers, details of their involvement in community-engaged projects, the setting, content/topic of study, level of engagement and related benefits/outcomes of such models. Focusing on the last 10 years, we conducted a comprehensive literature search twice between September 2016 and June 2017. The search resulted in 814 articles which were assessed for eligibility. Overall, 251 articles met our inclusion criteria and were categorised into three categories: empirical (n = 115); process/descriptive (n = 93); and ""about"" peers (n = 43). Findings suggest that there is a wide variety of peers, titles and terminology associated with peer models. There is inconsistency in how these models are used and implemented in research studies and projects. The majority of articles used an employment peer model, while only a handful involved peers in all phases of the project. The results of this literature review contribute to understanding the use, development and evolution of peer models. We highlight potential benefits of peer models for peers, their communities and community-engaged work, and we offer recommendations for future implementation of peer models.

Patient acceptability of wearable vital sign monitoring technologies in the acute care setting: A systematic review	"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine patient acceptability of wearable vital sign monitoring devices in the acute setting. BACKGROUND: Wearable vital sign monitoring devices may improve patient safety, yet hospital patients' acceptability of these devices is largely unreported. DESIGN: A systematic review. METHODS: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Complete, MEDLINE Complete and EMBASE were searched, supplemented by reference list hand searching. Studies were included if they involved adult hospital patients (>=18 years), a wearable monitoring device capable of assessing >=1 vital sign, and measured patient acceptability, satisfaction or experience of wearing the device. No date restrictions were enforced. Quality assessments of quantitative and qualitative studies were undertaken using the Downs and Black Checklist for Measuring Study Quality and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Research Checklist, respectively. Meta-analyses were not possible given data heterogeneity and low research quality. Reporting adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist was completed. RESULTS: Of the 427 studies screened, seven observational studies met the inclusion criteria. Six studies were of low quality and one was of high quality. In two studies, patient satisfaction was investigated. In the remaining studies, patient experience, patient opinions and experience, patient perceptions and experience, device acceptability, and patient comfort and concerns were investigated. In four studies, patients were mostly accepting of the wearable devices, reporting positive experiences and satisfaction relating to their use. In three studies, findings were mixed. CONCLUSION: There is limited high-quality research examining patient acceptability of wearable vital sign monitoring devices as an a priori focus in the acute setting. Further understanding of patient perspectives of these devices is required to inform their continued use and development. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The provision of patient-centred nursing care is contingent on understanding patients' preferences, including their acceptability of technology use.

Patient and caregiver perspectives on home hemodialysis: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Although home hemodialysis (HD) is associated with better survival compared with hospital HD, the burden of treatment may be intensified for patients and their caregivers and deter patients from this treatment choice. We describe patient and caregiver perspectives and experiences of home HD to inform home HD programs that align with patient preferences. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review of qualitative studies. SETTING & POPULATION: Adults with chronic kidney disease and caregivers of both home and hospital dialysis patients who expressed opinions about home HD. SEARCH STRATEGY & SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and reference lists were searched to October 2013. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Thematic synthesis. RESULTS: 24 studies involving 221 patients (home HD n=109], hospital HD n=97], and predialysis n=15]) and 121 caregivers were eligible. We identified 5 themes: vulnerability of dialyzing independently (fear of self-needling, feeling unqualified, and anticipating catastrophic complications), fear of being alone (social isolation and medical disconnection), concern of family burden (emotional demands on caregivers, imposing responsibility, family involvement, and medicalizing the home), opportunity to thrive (re-establishing a healthy self-identity, gaining control and freedom, strengthening relationships, experiencing improved health, and ownership of decision), and appreciating medical responsiveness (attentive monitoring and communication, depending on learning and support, developing readiness, and clinician validation). LIMITATIONS: Non-English articles were excluded. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and caregivers perceive that home HD offers the opportunity to thrive; improves freedom, flexibility, and well-being; and strengthens relationships. However, some voice anxiety and fear about starting home HD due to the confronting nature of the treatment and isolation from medical and social support. Acknowledging and addressing these apprehensions can improve the delivery of predialysis and home HD programs to better support patients and caregivers considering home HD.

Patient and health care professional decision-making to commence and withdraw from renal dialysis: a systematic review of qualitative research	"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To ensure that decisions to start and stop dialysis in ESRD are shared, the factors that affect patients and health care professionals in making such decisions must be understood. This systematic review sought to explore how and why different factors mediate the choices about dialysis treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsychINFO were searched for qualitative studies of factors that affect patients' or health care professionals' decisions to commence or withdraw from dialysis. A thematic synthesis was conducted. RESULTS: Of 494 articles screened, 12 studies (conducted from 1985 to 2014) were included. These involved 206 patients (most receiving hemodialysis) and 64 health care professionals (age ranges: patients, 26-93 years; professionals, 26-61 years). For commencing dialysis, patients based their choice on ""gut instinct,"" as well as deliberating over the effect of treatment on quality of life and survival. How individuals coped with decision-making was influential: Some tried to take control of the problem of progressive renal failure, whereas others focused on controlling their emotions. Health care professionals weighed biomedical factors and were led by an instinct to prolong life. Both patients and health care professionals described feeling powerless. With regard to dialysis withdrawal, only after prolonged periods on dialysis were the realities of life on dialysis fully appreciated and past choices questioned. By this stage, however, patients were physically dependent on treatment. As was seen with commencing dialysis, individuals coped with treatment withdrawal in a problem- or emotion-controlling way. Families struggled to differentiate between choosing versus allowing death. Health care teams avoided and queried discussions regarding dialysis withdrawal. Patients, however, missed the dialogue they experienced during predialysis education. CONCLUSIONS: Decision-making in ESRD is complex and dynamic and evolves over time and toward death. The factors at work are multifaceted and operate differently for patients and health professionals. More training and research on open communication and shared decision-making are needed.

Patient experiences of partnering with healthcare professionals for hand hygiene compliance: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections pose a significant risk to patients in acute healthcare settings such as hospitals. Increasingly, patients are encouraged to be active participants and partner with healthcare professionals to positively influence their own safety and overall experience throughout their healthcare journey. Patient-focused safety initiatives include the empowerment of patients to be active partners with healthcare professionals in order to influence the hand hygiene behaviors and compliance of the healthcare professionals providing care to them. Partnering within the context of healthcare, and between the patient and healthcare professional, can be considered as a general concept that involves the empowerment of patients to participate in their care. Terms used to describe patient partnering within healthcare vary and include patient participation, patient-centeredness, patient empowerment and patient engagement. Although patients appear generally to have positive attitudes and intentions about engaging in their safety and partnering in the healthcare setting, their intentions and actual behaviors vary considerably. Patients appear less likely to engage in behaviors that require questioning of the perceived or real authority of healthcare professionals. A patient's intention and subsequent act of partnering with healthcare professionals for hand hygiene compliance by the healthcare professional are influenced by complex internal, external and social factors as well as cultural, behavioral and systematic factors. OBJECTIVES: To determine the best available evidence in relation to the experiences of the patient partnering with healthcare professionals for hand hygiene compliance. INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: The current review considered qualitative (critical or interpretive) papers that included adult in-patients and healthcare professionals (medical and nursing staff), in the acute hospital-care setting. Adult was considered to be any person aged 18 years or over. It should be noted that consumers in this context were patients and vice versa; the term patient is therefore used throughout this report for consistency. PHENOMENA OF INTEREST: The current review considered studies that investigated the experience of partnership between patients and healthcare professionals in relation to hand hygiene compliance. This review investigated the phenomena of partnering from both the perspectives of the patient and the healthcare professional. TYPES OF STUDIES: The current review considered studies that focused on qualitative data including, but not limited to, designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research and feminist research. As qualitative studies were identified and on appraisal found to be of sufficient quality for inclusion, this review did not seek alternate forms of evidence such as text and opinion. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy aimed to find both published and unpublished studies from 1990 to May 2015. Studies published in English were considered for inclusion in this review. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Qualitative papers selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI). DATA EXTRACTION: Qualitative data were extracted from papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI-QARI. DATA SYNTHESIS: Qualitative research findings were pooled using JBI-QARI. RESULTS: Following the systematic search and critical appraisal process, three studies were included in the review for data extraction and synthesis of findings. The review process resulted in 29 study findings that were aggregated into seven categories. The categories generated two meta-synthesized findings. The two final synthesized findings were as follows. Synthesized finding 1: Organizational structures enable partnering between healthcare professionals and patients for hand hygiene compliance; however, the culture, beliefs and behaviors of healthcare professionals and patients do not fully support this partnership. Synthesized finding 2: Patients have differing levels of knowledge and balance partnering in hand hygiene against possible detrimental impacts on the caring relationship provided by healthcare professionals, out of concern for their own wellbeing, health outcomes, treatment and/or recovery. CONCLUSION: The current review highlights the complexity of the patient's experience of partnering with healthcare professionals for hand hygiene compliance. The experiences reported indicated that there is a possible disparity between the healthcare facility and healthcare professionals' promotion and intention of partnering for hand hygiene compliance, and the actual patient's acceptance, participation, partnership, experience and implementation of this initiative. This disconnect between intent and action appears to be influenced by a number of factors including organizational structures as well as drivers such as cultural beliefs and behavior."
Patient focused Internet-based approaches to cardiovascular rehabilitation--a systematic review	"Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been shown to improve health behaviours and risk factors and the evidence suggests that home CR is as effective as hospital-based CR. Telemedicine offers the potential for more patients to engage in CR. We reviewed the evidence for patient focused Internet-based approaches to cardiovascular rehabilitation. Searches were performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. In total, nine studies involving 830 patients with heart disease that compared Internet-based cardiac rehabilitation to usual care were identified. The quality of trials was assessed using the Jadad scale. Outcome data were pooled under four subheadings: compliance; physical activity outcomes; clinical outcomes; psychosocial outcomes. Compliance rates were high but dropped over time in all studies. Physical activity measures were generally improved, as were clinical outcomes. Changes in psychosocial measures were positive, with two studies noting no change. No interventions noted a negative effect on outcomes. Despite the relatively small number of trials and the limited outcome measures, the results appeared to be positive with regard to patient outcomes and patient feedback. However, none had progressed to a clinical service."
Patient goals in rheumatoid arthritis care: A systematic review and qualitative synthesis	"OBJECTIVE: During the clinical encounter, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patient goals for care often go unexplored. The aim of the present systematic review was to identify needs, goals and expectations of RA patients in order better to guide systematic elicitation of patient goals in clinical encounters. METHODS: An academic librarian searched MEDLINE, PsychINFO and the Cochrane Library using a specialized algorithm developed to identify articles about patient goals for RA care. Investigators screened search results according to prespecified inclusion criteria and then reviewed included articles and synthesized the evidence qualitatively, utilizing an inductive approach. RESULTS: A total of 909 titles were retrieved in the literature search, of which 871 were excluded after a title/abstract screen. Of the remaining 38, 22 papers were included in the final review. Investigators identified four major themes in the literature: (a) the bodily experience of RA; (b) achieving normalcy and maintaining wellness; (c) social connectedness and support; and (d) interpersonal and healthcare system interactions. CONCLUSION: Patients' goals when receiving care for RA are multidimensional and span several facets of everyday life. Goals for RA care should be collaboratively developed between patients and providers, with particular attention to the patient's life context and priorities.

Patient Involvement in Healthcare-Associated Infection Research: A Lexical Review	"OBJECTIVE: This review examines patient involvement in healthcare-associated infection (HAI) research. Healthcare-associated infections represent an intractable issue with considerable implications for patients and staff. Participatory methodologies that involve patients in healthcare research are associated with myriad benefits. DESIGN: Lexical review. METHODS: PubMed was searched to identify all publications on patient involvement in HAI research since 2000; publications were also identified from the cited references. A lexical analysis was conducted of the methods sections of 148 publications. RESULTS: The findings reveal that HAI research that actively involves patients and members of the public is limited. CONCLUSIONS: Patient involvement is largely limited to recruitment to HAI studies rather than extended to patient involvement in research design, implementation, analysis, and/or dissemination. As such, there is considerable opportunity to further this important research area via alternative methodologies that award primacy to patient expertise and agency.

Patient issues in health research and quality of care: an inventory and data synthesis	"Aim The purpose of this review is to generate an inventory of issues that matter from a patient perspective in health research and quality of care. From these issues, criteria will be elicited to support patient(s) (groups) in their role as advisor or advocate when appraising health research, health policy and quality of health care. Background Literature shows that patients are beginning to develop their own voice and agenda's with issues in order to be prepared for the collaboration with professionals. Yet, patient issues have not been investigated systematically. This review addresses what patients find important and help to derive patient criteria for appraising research and quality of care. Methods/search strategy Information was gathered from Western countries with similar economic, societal and health-care situations. We searched (from January 2000 to March 2010) for primary sources, secondary sources and tertiary sources; non-scientific publications were also included. Results The international inventory of issues that were defined by patients is covering a large array of domains. In total, 35 issue clusters further referred to as criteria were found ranging from dignity to cost effectiveness and family involvement. Issues from a patient perspective reveal patient values and appear to be adding to professional issues. Conclusions Patient issues cover a broad domain, including fundamental values, quality of life, quality of care and personal development. Quite a few issues do not find its reflection in the scientific literature in spite of their clear and obvious appearance from tertiary sources. This may indicate a gap between the scientific research community and patient networks."
Patient participation in clinical encounters: a systematic review to identify self-report measures	"BACKGROUND: There is evidence suggesting that active participation of patients in their health care can improve the quality of care and decrease health-care costs. Further, patient reports of their health-care experience are increasingly used to monitor health-care quality. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes a systematic review of peer-reviewed studies to identify measures of patients' active participation in their encounters with health-care providers. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted for publications indexed from 1975 to 2011. Of interest were self-reported measures of patient participation that were not limited to a specific health concern. All abstracts were reviewed independently by two authors, and the full paper was considered for those meeting inclusion criteria. MAIN RESULTS: From a review of 4528 citations, ten measures were identified. The approaches to development of the measures varied considerably, as did their study samples and their psychometric quality. DISCUSSION: These measures represented three conceptual frameworks: empowerment and self-efficacy, therapeutic alliance, and consumerism/satisfaction. They provide a more comprehensive perspective of patients' experiences of their provider encounters, and a better understanding patient behaviour enhanced the quality of health-care delivery or improved health outcomes. These measures underscore the continuing challenge of defining patient participation and the multiple theoretical approaches that underlie this form of patient behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Current interest in quality-related physician report cards gives significant weight to patients' self-reported experiences as one dimension of physician performance. It is critical to identify the specific focus and quality of measures selected for this and research purposes. Copyright ¬© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
Patient participation in nursing care on medical wards: An integrative review	"Background: Patient participation is a way for patients to engage in their nursing care. In view of the possible link between patient participation and safety, there is a need for an updated review to assess patient participation in nursing care. Objectives: To investigate patients' and nurses' perceptions of and behaviours towards patient participation in nursing care in the context of hospital medical wards. Design: Integrative review. Data sources: Three search strategies were employed in August 2013; a computerised database search of Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Library, Medline and PsychINFO; reference lists were hand-searched; and forward citation searching was executed. Review methods: After reviewing the studies, extracting study data and completing summary tables the methodological quality was assessed using the Mixed-Methods Assessment Tool by two reviewers. Reviewers met then to discuss discrepancies as well as the overall strengths and limitations of the studies. Discrepancies were overcome through consensus or a third reviewer adjudicated the issue. Within and across study analysis and synthesis of the findings sections was undertaken using thematic synthesis. Results: Eight studies met inclusion criteria. Four themes were identified - enacting participation, challenges to participation, promoting participation and types of participation. Most studies included were conducted in Europe. The majority of studies used qualitative methodologies, with all studies sampling patients; nurses were included in three studies. Data were largely collected using self-reported perceptions; two studies included observational data. Methodological issues included a lack of reflexivity, unvalidated data collection tools, sampling issues and low response rates. Conclusions: On medical wards, patients and nurses desire, perceive or enact patient participation passively. Challenging factors for patient participation include patients' willingness, nurses' approach and confusion around expectations and roles. Information-sharing was identified as an activity that promotes patient participation, suggesting nurses encourage active communication with patients in practice. Involving patients in assessment and care planning may also enhance patient participation. For education, enhancing nurses' understanding of the attributes of patient participation, as well as patient-centred care approaches may be beneficial for medical ward nurses. From here, researchers need to examine ways to overcome the barriers to patient participation; further nurse participants and observational data is required on medical wards."
Patient participation in patient safety and nursing input - a systematic review	"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aims to synthesise the existing research on how patients participate in patient safety initiatives. BACKGROUND: Ambiguities remain about how patients participate in routine measures designed to promote patient safety. DESIGN: Systematic review using integrative methods. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched using keywords describing patient involvement, nursing input and patient safety initiatives to retrieve empirical research published between 2007 and 2013. Findings were synthesized using the theoretical domains of Vincent's framework for analysing risk and safety in clinical practice: ""patient"", ""healthcare provider"", ""task"", ""work environment"", ""organisation & management"". RESULTS: We identified 17 empirical research papers: four qualitative, one mixed-method and 12 quantitative designs. All 17 papers indicated that patients can participate in safety initiatives. CONCLUSIONS: Improving patient participation in patient safety necessitates considering the patient as a person, the nurse as healthcare provider, the task of participation and the clinical environment. Patients' knowledge, health conditions, beliefs and experiences influence their decisions to engage in patient safety initiatives. An important component of the management of long-term conditions is to ensure that patients have sufficient knowledge to participate. Healthcare providers may need further professional development in patient education and patient care management to promote patient involvement in patient safety, and ensure that patients understand that they are 'allowed' to inform nurses of adverse events or errors. A healthcare system characterised by patient-centredness and mutual acknowledgement will support patient participation in safety practices. Further research is required to improve international knowledge of patient participation in patient safety in different disciplines, contexts and cultures. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Patients have a significant role to play in enhancing their own safety while receiving hospital care. This review offers a framework for clinicians to develop comprehensive practical guidelines to support patient involvement in patient safety. Copyright ¬© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
Patient participation in pro re nata medication in psychiatric inpatient settings: An integrative review	"Abstract: Pro re nata (PRN) medication is widely used and studied in psychiatric care, but our knowledge about patient participation in its administration is fragmented. The aim of this integrative review was to describe and synthesize previous knowledge of patient participation in PRN in psychiatric inpatient settings. We conducted both electronic and manual searches, using the CINAHL, Scopus, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases, and eight scientific journals. Searches were limited to the English language, to the years 2006Äì2016, and to selected papers using inclusion, exclusion, and quality criteria. We identified 16 relevant papers, and these showed that patient participation included patient-related starting points, including the patients"" willingness to participate and their knowledge of the medication. The patients"" participation in PRN practices was demonstrated by the opportunity to request PRN and to refuse any PRN that was offered. Patient participation was shown to be linked to certain¬situations where PRN was recommended. The role that the professionals played in patient participation included interacting with patients, providing counselling and alternatives for PRN. Our results also revealed that coercion was used administering PRN. The existing literature exposed challenges that need to be addressed if patient participation in the use of PRN medication is to be effectively achieved in psychiatric inpatient settings. Equal partnerships between patients, nurses, and physicians are an essential part of this process, and further research into PRN medication is urgently needed, particularly studies that focus on patients"" experiences."
Patient Preferences and Shared Decision Making in the Treatment of Substance Use Disorders: A Systematic Review of the Literature	"BACKGROUND: Shared Decision Making (SDM) as means to the involvement of patients in medical decision making is increasingly demanded by treatment guidelines and legislation. Also, matching of patients' preferences to treatments has been shown to be effective regarding symptom reduction. Despite promising results for patients with substance use disorders (SUD) no systematic evaluation of the literature has been provided. The aim is therefore to give a systematic overview of the literature of patient preferences and SDM in the treatment of patients with SUD. METHODS: An electronic literature search of the databases Medline, Embase, Psyndex and Clinical Trials Register was performed. Variations of the search terms substance use disorders, patient preferences and SDM were used. For data synthesis the populations, interventions and outcomes were summarized and described according to the PRISMA statement. Methodological quality of the included articles was assessed with the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. RESULTS: N = 25 trials were included in this review. These were conducted between 1986 and 2014 with altogether n = 8.729 patients. Two studies found that patients with SUD preferred to be actively involved in treatment decisions. Treatment preferences were assessed in n = 18 studies, where the majority of patients preferred outpatient compared with inpatient treatment. Matching patients to preferences resulted in a reduction on substance use (n = 3 studies), but the majority of studies found no significant effect. Interventions for SDM differed across patient populations and optional therapeutic techniques. DISCUSSION: Patients with substance use disorders should be involved in medical treatment decisions, as patients with other health conditions. A suitable approach is Shared Decision Making, emphasizing the patients' preferences. However, due to the heterogeneity of the included studies, results should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed regarding SDM interventions in patient populations with substance use disorders."
Patient reported measures of informed consent for clinical trials: A systematic review	"INTRODUCTION: The subjective assessment of the adequacy of informed consent for clinical trials, and the potential difficulties associated with it, has led several studies to develop objective measures of informed consent for clinical trials. These objective measures of informed consent are often specific to a particular population or clinical condition and largely focus on understanding of (some or all of) the key elements of informed consent. Many of the developed tools are study-specific, but some validated measures exist. Of these validated measures, those which are reported by participants are of particular interest. Whether these objective tools conceptualize and measure informed consent in the same way is not known. As such, it is not clear whether meta-analyzing data from studies reporting different tools is worthwhile. The aim of this systematic review was to critically appraise the evidence on the overall conceptualisation and item content of validated patient reported measures of informed consent for clinical trials, and to identify core domains of potential importance for informed consent. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was conducted to identify relevant articles that described the development, and/or validation, of patient-reported measures of adequacy of informed consent for randomised controlled trials. Data was synthesised by classifying the items identified into domains and sub-domains which were determined by the nomenclature reported in included studies. Both for descriptions of included studies and of the instruments reported in those studies, descriptive statistics were used to describe general information and instrument detail. A narrative synthesis of the instruments and their inter-related domains and subdomains was conducted to identify areas of both convergence and divergence. RESULTS: The search identified 8193 citations. After screening titles and abstracts, 29 full text articles were retrieved for further assessment. Of these 29, 14 complied with our pre-specified inclusion criteria with 15 not being eligible. Of the 14 instruments, three explicitly reported a theoretical or conceptual framework underpinning their development, a further three implicitly referred to the 'conceptual dimensions of informed consent' or 'principles of research ethics' as informing their development and eight reported no guiding theoretical framework. Only three of the 14 studies reported patient or public involvement in the development of the tool. One hundred and seventy nine items were included across the 14 instruments. The primary focus of the instruments was on understanding. Five core domains were identified which included: Autonomy; Consequences; Expectations; Purpose; and Individualisation. There was substantial variability in the coverage of different domains across measures. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the variability in the theoretical underpinning, development and domain coverage of existing patient-reported measures of informed consent for clinical trials. The conceptualisation of informed consent could benefit from being extended from a narrow focus on understanding to include broader considerations of decision-making. Meaningful involvement of potential trial participants during development of measures critical for tool relevance is also lacking. The identification of the key domains relevant to all stakeholders which could be measured to assess the informed consent process for clinical trials is needed."
Patient satisfaction with medication for gastroesophageal reflux disease: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Patient satisfaction is increasingly regarded as an important aspect of measuring treatment success in individuals with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). OBJECTIVE: To review how satisfied patients with GERD are with their medication, and to analyze the usefulness of patient satisfaction as a clinical end point by comparing it with symptom improvement. METHODS: Systematic searches of the PubMed and EMBASE databases identified clinical trials and patient surveys published between 1966 and 2009. RESULTS: Twelve trials reported that 56% to 100% of patients were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment for GERD. Patient satisfaction levels were higher for PPIs than other GERD medications in two trials. The sample-size-weighted average proportion of patients 'satisfied' with their PPI after four weeks of treatment in trials was 93% (95% CI 87% to 99%), with 73% (95% CI 62% to 83%) being 'very satisfied'. In four surveys, the average proportion of patients 'satisfied' with their PPI treatment was 82% (95% CI 73% to 90%) and 62% (95% CI 48% to 75%) were 'very satisfied'. Seven trials found a positive association between patient satisfaction and symptom improvement, and two surveys between satisfaction and improved health-related quality of life. Three trials found that continuous treatment yielded higher rates of satisfaction than on-demand therapy. CONCLUSIONS: More than one-half of patients were satisfied with their PPI medication in trials, and more patients were satisfied with PPIs than other medication types. An association between patient satisfaction and symptom resolution was found, suggesting that patient satisfaction is a useful end point for evaluating GERD treatment success."
Patient-centred communication is associated with positive therapeutic alliance: a systematic review	"QUESTION: During the patient-therapist encounter, which communication factors correlate with constructs of therapeutic alliance? DESIGN: Systematic review. PARTICIPANTS: Clinicians and patients in primary, secondary or tertiary care settings. MEASURES: Studies had to investigate the association between communication factors (interaction styles, verbal factors or non-verbal factors) and constructs of the therapeutic alliance (collaboration, affective bond, agreement, trust, or empathy), measured during encounters between health practitioners and patients. RESULTS: Among the twelve studies that met the inclusion criteria, 67 communication factors were identified (36 interaction styles, 17 verbal factors and 14 non-verbal factors). The constructs of therapeutic alliance in the included studies were rapport, trust, communicative success and agreement. Interaction styles that showed positive large correlations with therapeutic alliance were those factors that help clinicians to engage more with patients by listening to what they have to say, asking questions and showing sensitivity to their emotional concerns. Studies of verbal and non-verbal factors were scarce and inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: The limited evidence suggests patient-centred interaction styles related to the provision of emotional support and allowing patient involvement in the consultation process enhance the therapeutic alliance. Clinicians can use this evidence to adjust their interactions with patients to include communication strategies that strengthen the therapeutic alliance.

Patient-controlled hospital admission in psychiatry: A systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Patient-controlled admission is a concept that invites patients with long-term mental illness to decide for themselves when inpatient treatment is necessary without a clinician serving as gatekeeper. AIM: To review the current knowledge of patient-controlled hospital admission in adult psychiatry. METHOD: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library with the aim of identifying all relevant scientific papers from 1990 onwards. RESULTS: Six articles reporting on four different study sites were identified. Detailed account of the models is given and quantitative and qualitative outcome data is reviewed. Rationales behind the concept include increased patient autonomy, promotion of coping skills, early help-seeking, avoidance of power struggles, establishment of an asylum function, reduced time spent in inpatient care and prevention of coercive measures. Quantitative data points toward a dramatic reduction of total time spent in inpatient care and of involuntary admissions in patients with previously high inpatient care consumption, whereas qualitative data indicates that the concept increases patient autonomy, responsibility and confidence in daily life. CONCLUSION: Patient-controlled admission is a promising novel approach to inpatient care in psychiatry. However, available studies are small and quality of evidence is generally low."
"Patient-initiated second opinions: systematic review of characteristics and impact on diagnosis, treatment, and satisfaction"	"The impact of second opinions on diagnosis in radiology and pathology is well documented; however, the value of patient-initiated second opinions for diagnosis and treatment in general medical practice is unknown. We conducted a systematic review of patient-initiated second opinions to assess their impact on clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction and to determine characteristics and motivating factors of patients who seek a second opinion. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Academic OneFile databases using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) indexes and keyword searches. Search terms included referral and consultation, patient-initiated, patient preference, patient participation, second opinion, second review, and diagnosis. Multiple reviewers screened abstracts and articles to determine eligibility and extract data. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and rated study quality using Cochrane's GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. We screened 1342 abstracts and reviewed full text of 41 articles, identifying 7 articles that reported clinical agreement data and 10 that discussed patient characteristics, motivation, and satisfaction. We found that a second opinion typically confirms the original diagnosis or treatment regimen but that 90% of patients with poorly defined conditions remain undiagnosed. However, 10% to 62% of second opinions yield a major change in the diagnosis, treatment, or prognosis. A larger fraction of patients receive different advice on treatment than on diagnosis. Factors motivating a second opinion include diagnosis or treatment confirmation, dissatisfaction with a consultation, desire for more information, persistent symptoms, or treatment complications. Patients generally believed that second opinions were valuable. Second opinions can result in diagnostic and treatment differences. The literature on patient-initiated second opinions is limited, and the accuracy of the second opinion through follow-up is generally unknown. Standardized methods and outcome measures are needed to determine the value of second opinions, and the potential of second opinions to reduce diagnostic errors merits more rigorous evaluation.

Patient-mediated interventions to improve professional practice	"BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals are important contributors to healthcare quality and patient safety, but their performance does not always follow recommended clinical practice. There are many approaches to influencing practice among healthcare professionals. These approaches include audit and feedback, reminders, educational materials, educational outreach visits, educational meetings or conferences, use of local opinion leaders, financial incentives, and organisational interventions. In this review, we evaluated the effectiveness of patient-mediated interventions. These interventions are aimed at changing the performance of healthcare professionals through interactions with patients, or through information provided by or to patients. Examples of patient-mediated interventions include 1) patient-reported health information, 2) patient information, 3) patient education, 4) patient feedback about clinical practice, 5) patient decision aids, 6) patients, or patient representatives, being members of a committee or board, and 7) patient-led training or education of healthcare professionals. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of patient-mediated interventions on healthcare professionals' performance (adherence to clinical practice guidelines or recommendations for clinical practice). SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Ovid in March 2018, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in March 2017, and ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry (ICTRP) in September 2017, and OpenGrey, the Grey Literature Report and Google Scholar in October 2017. We also screened the reference lists of included studies and conducted cited reference searches for all included studies in October 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised studies comparing patient-mediated interventions to either usual care or other interventions to improve professional practice. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes using Mantel-Haenszel statistics and the random-effects model. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) using inverse variance statistics. Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). MAIN RESULTS: We included 25 studies with a total of 12,268 patients. The number of healthcare professionals included in the studies ranged from 12 to 167 where this was reported. The included studies evaluated four types of patient-mediated interventions: 1) patient-reported health information interventions (for instance information obtained from patients about patients' own health, concerns or needs before a clinical encounter), 2) patient information interventions (for instance, where patients are informed about, or reminded to attend recommended care), 3) patient education interventions (intended to increase patients' knowledge about their condition and options of care, for instance), and 4) patient decision aids (where the patient is provided with information about treatment options including risks and benefits). For each type of patient-mediated intervention a separate meta-analysis was produced.Patient-reported health information interventions probably improve healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (moderate-certainty evidence). We found that for every 100 patients consulted or treated, 26 (95% CI 23 to 30) are in accordance with recommended clinical practice compared to 17 per 100 in the comparison group (no intervention or usual care). We are uncertain about the effect of patient-reported health information interventions on desirable patient health outcomes and patient satisfaction (very low-certainty evidence). Undesirable patient health outcomes and adverse events were not reported in the included studies and resource use was poorly reported.Patient information interventions may improve healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (low-certainty evidence). We found that for every 100 patients consulted or treated, 32 (95% CI 24 to 42) are in accordance with recommended clinical practice compared to 20 per 100 in the comparison group (no intervention or usual care). Patient information interventions may have little or no effect on desirable patient health outcomes and patient satisfaction (low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of patient information interventions on undesirable patient health outcomes because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Adverse events and resource use were not reported in the included studies.Patient education interventions probably improve healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (moderate-certainty evidence). We found that for every 100 patients consulted or treated, 46 (95% CI 39 to 54) are in accordance with recommended clinical practice compared to 35 per 100 in the comparison group (no intervention or usual care). Patient education interventions may slightly increase the number of patients with desirable health outcomes (low-certainty evidence). Undesirable patient health outcomes, patient satisfaction, adverse events and resource use were not reported in the included studies.Patient decision aid interventions may have little or no effect on healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (low-certainty evidence). We found that for every 100 patients consulted or treated, 32 (95% CI 24 to 43) are in accordance with recommended clinical practice compared to 37 per 100 in the comparison group (usual care). Patient health outcomes, patient satisfaction, adverse events and resource use were not reported in the included studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found that two types of patient-mediated interventions, patient-reported health information and patient education, probably improve professional practice by increasing healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (moderate-certainty evidence). We consider the effect to be small to moderate. Other patient-mediated interventions, such as patient information may also improve professional practice (low-certainty evidence). Patient decision aids may make little or no difference to the number of healthcare professionals' adhering to recommended clinical practice (low-certainty evidence).The impact of these interventions on patient health and satisfaction, adverse events and resource use, is more uncertain mostly due to very low certainty evidence or lack of evidence."
Patient-mediated knowledge translation (PKT) interventions for clinical encounters: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Patient-mediated knowledge translation (PKT) interventions engage patients in their own health care. Insight on which PKT interventions are effective is lacking. We sought to describe the type and impact of PKT interventions. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of PKT interventions, defined as strategies that inform, educate and engage patients in their own health care. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library from 2005 to 2014 for English language studies that evaluated PKT interventions delivered immediately before, during or upon conclusion of clinical encounters to individual patients with arthritis or cancer. Data were extracted on study characteristics, PKT intervention (theory, content, delivery, duration, personnel, timing) and outcomes. Interventions were characterized by type of patient engagement (inform, activate, collaborate). We performed content analysis and reported summary statistics. RESULTS: Of 694 retrieved studies, 16 were deemed eligible (5 arthritis, 11 cancer; 12 RCTs, 4 cohort studies; 7 low, 3 uncertain, 6 high risk of bias). PKT interventions included print material in 10 studies (brochures, booklets, variety of print material, list of websites), electronic material in 10 studies (video, computer program, website) and counselling in 2 studies. They were offered before, during and after consultation in 4, 1 and 4 studies, respectively; as single or multifaceted interventions in 10 and 6 studies, respectively; and by clinicians, health educators, researchers or volunteers in 4, 3, 5 and 1 study, respectively. Most interventions informed or activated patients. All studies achieved positive impact in one or more measures of patient knowledge, decision-making, communication and behaviour. This was true regardless of condition, PKT intervention, timing, personnel, type of engagement or delivery (single or multifaceted). No studies assessed patient harms, or interventions for providers to support PKT intervention delivery. Two studies evaluated the impact on providers of PKT interventions aimed at patients. CONCLUSIONS: Single interventions involving print material achieved beneficial outcomes as did more complex interventions. Few studies were eligible, and no studies evaluated patient harms, or provider outcomes. Further research is warranted to evaluate these PKT interventions in more patients, or patients with different conditions; different types of PKT interventions for patients and for providers; and potential harms associated with interventions."
Patients' decision making in total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review of qualitative research.	"OBJECTIVES: A patient-centred approach, usually achieved through shared decision making, has the potential to help improve decision making around knee arthroplasty surgery. However, such an approach requires an understanding of the factors involved in patient decision making. This review's objective is to systematically examine the qualitative literature surrounding patients' decision making in knee arthroplasty. METHODS: A systematic literature review using Medline and Embase was conducted to identify qualitative studies that examined patients' decision making around knee arthroplasty. An aggregated account of what is known about patients' decision making in knee arthroplasties is provided. RESULTS: Seven studies with 234 participants in interviews or focus groups are included. Ten themes are replicated across studies, namely: expectations of surgery; coping mechanisms; relationship with clinician; fear; pain; function; psychological implications; social network; previous experience of surgery; and conflict in opinions. CONCLUSIONS: This review is helpful in not only directing future research to areas that are not understood, or require confirmation, but also in highlighting areas that future interventions could address. These include those aimed at delivering information, which are likely to affect the satisfaction rate, demand, and use of knee arthroplasties. Cite this article: Bone Joint Res 2015;4;163-169.

Patients' experiences of chronic non-malignant musculoskeletal pain: a qualitative systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is one of the most predominant types of pain and accounts for a large portion of the primary care workload. AIM: To systematically review and integrate the findings of qualitative research to increase understanding of patients' experiences of chronic non-malignant MSK pain. DESIGN AND SETTING: Synthesis of qualitative research using meta-ethnography using six electronic databases up until February 2012 (Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Psychinfo, Amed and HMIC). METHOD: Databases were searched from their inception until February 2012, supplemented by hand-searching contents lists of specific journals for 2001-2011 and citation tracking. Full published reports of qualitative studies exploring adults' own experience of chronic non-malignant MSK pain were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: Out of 24 992 titles, 676 abstracts, and 321 full texts were screened, 77 papers reporting 60 individual studies were included. A new concept of pain as an adversarial struggle emerged. This adversarial struggle was to: 1) affirm self; 2) reconstruct self in time; 3) construct an explanation for suffering; 4) negotiate the healthcare system; and 5) prove legitimacy. However, despite this struggle there is also a sense for some patients of 6) moving forward alongside pain. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a theoretical underpinning for improving patient experience and facilitating a therapeutic collaborative partnership. A conceptual model is presented, which offers opportunities for improvement by involving patients, showing them their pain is understood, and forming the basis to help patients move forward alongside their pain."
Patients' involvement in improvement initiatives: a qualitative systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Over the last 20 years, quality improvement in health has become an important strategy in health services in many countries. With the emphasis on quality health care, there has been a shift in social paradigms towards including service users in their own health on different levels. There is growing evidence in literature on the positive impact on health outcomes where patients are active participants in their personal care. There is however less information available on the broader influence of users on improvement in systems. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to identify the barriers and enablers to patients being involved in quality improvement efforts directed towards their own health care. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review considered studies that included adults and children of any age experiencing any health problem.The review considered studies that explored patient or user participation in quality improvement and the factors enabling and hindering this processThe qualitative component of this review considered studies that focused on qualitative data, including, but not limited to, designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research and feminist research. Other texts such as opinion papers and reports were also considered. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy aimed to find both published and unpublished studies. A three-step search strategy was utilized in this review. The searches using all identified keywords and index terms included the databases PubMed, PsycINFO, Medline, Scopus, EBSCOhost and CINAHL.Qualitative, text and opinion papers were considered for inclusion in this review.Closely related concepts like community involvement, family involvement, patients' involvement in their own care (for example, in the case of shared decision making), and patient centeredness in the context of a consultation were excluded. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Qualitative and textual papers selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for authenticity prior to inclusion in the review using the standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA EXTRACTION: Qualitative and textual data were extracted from papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA SYNTHESIS: The above findings were pooled and through the identification of categories, a final meta-synthesis was formulated. RESULTS: Two synthesized findings were created from the included papers. Firstly, there are barriers to patients' participation in quality improvement in health and in spite of policy support for user involvement in quality improvement, it is a difficult strategy to implement. The second synthesized finding was that there are enablers to patients' involvement in quality improvement: when patients are involved in quality improvement efforts in health care, there are innovative, often unexpected, outcomes at different levels of the process, and sustaining these efforts is possible with ongoing individual or group support.Five categories which supported the synthesized findings were created through the meta-aggregative process. CONCLUSIONS: There are enablers and barriers to involving patients in quality improvement in health care that need to be considered when planning such interventions.Relationships and roles will need to be very clear from the outset. A developmental approach needs to be considered where support and training is part of the project. Where patients are truly engaged in service improvement, unexpected innovation occurs.There are many more reports and opinion papers published regarding this topic than there are rigorous research studies. This leaves the field open to the development of good methodological studies related to quality improvement and in particular to the participation of patients."
Patients' perspectives and experience of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies.	"OBJECTIVE: To describe the range and depth of perspectives and experiences of patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis to inform gaps in patient centred care. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL were searched to April 2018. Thematic synthesis was used to analyse the findings. RESULTS: We included 56 studies involving 1484 adult patients with psoriasis (n = 1147) and psoriatic arthritis (n = 337). Six themes (and subthemes) were identified: suffering uncontrollable and ongoing upheaval (dictating life choices and course, disrupting family and social roles, limited by debilitating symptoms, unstoppable and far reaching fatigue); weighed down by mental load (anxiety provoked by the volatility of symptoms, dreading deterioration, struggling with unrecognized distress, helpless and nihilistic); harboring shame and judgement (marked as unhygienic and contagious, rejected and isolated, hiding away and resenting own appearance, pain and embarrassment in intimacy); demoralized by inadequacies and burden of therapy (disappointed by unmet expectations of treatment benefit, daily drudgery, deterred by unpalatable or inconvenient treatments, disempowered by lack of personalized care); gaining control (making sense of the condition, accepting a new health status, regaining independence and normality, attuning to the body); and making confident treatment decisions (trading off perceptible benefits against safety and convenience, relying on family input, seeking empowering and reassuring relationships). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis contend with disruption in their functioning, roles and life course, and have unmet expectations about treatment. Enhanced therapeutic relationships, addressing treatment expectations, and supporting psychosocial needs may improve satisfaction and outcomes. This article is protected by copyright.

Patients' perspectives on opt-out consent for observational research: systematic review and focus group.	"BACKGROUND:: observational research is increasingly important in clinical decision-making. Opt-out consent has been proposed as a more practical way to obtain participants' consent for such research. The authors evaluated patients' views on opt-out consent for observational research by identifying perceived benefits and barriers. METHODS:: following a systematic literature review of research on participants' perspectives on opt-out consent, a focus group interview was conducted with oncological patients and their family members. RESULTS:: the review identified 13 articles detailing perspectives on opt-out consent. Perceived advantages included benefitting medicine and future generations. These findings were confirmed in the focus group. The main reported barriers to opt-out consent are concerns regarding privacy and the sharing of data with third parties. Participants also demonstrated concerns on insufficient education on opt-out consent. CONCLUSION:: participants demonstrated willingness to participate in observational studies utilising opt-out consent. Special focus should be placed on outlining existing safeguards in research."
Patients' psychosocial experiences of attending Specialist Palliative Day Care: A systematic review.	"Recent reviews conclude that the benefits of attending Specialist Palliative Day Care (SPDC) are likely to be in social, psychological and spiritual domains. However, these areas are not easily identified, leaving researchers and practitioners unclear as to what aspects of these domains patients most need and desire. The objective of this review was to systematically evaluate literature on patient-perceived psychosocial experiences of attendance at SPDC. Twelve studies were included. Evidence showed that patients value a person-centred approach that reduces isolation, increases social support, encourages communication and provides activities. Future research could focus on investigating why patients value the psychosocial experiences reported and how these experiences can be defined in a way that would be meaningful to clinical service commissioners. Once this has been done, clinicians can start to measure more effectively clinical effectiveness and devise justifiable interventions to help this patient group. ¬© The Author(s) 2010."
Pedestrian navigation and public transit training interventions for youth with disabilities: a systematic review.	"PURPOSE: Being able to travel independently, whether as a pedestrian or by taking public transportation, is a critical element to maintaining quality of life and participation in the community. The objective of this systematic review is to understand the best practices and effective components of pedestrian and public transit training interventions for youth with disabilities. METHOD: Systematic searches of seven international databases identified 29 studies meeting our inclusion criteria. We analyzed these studies based on participant characteristics, methods, results, and quality of evidence. RESULTS: Among the 29 studies, 857 participants (aged 5-39, mean 18.3 years) were represented across 10 countries. Although the intervention outcomes varied across the studies, 24 of them reported an improvement in at least one of the following: pedestrian and general navigation skills, pedestrian safety, landmark recognition, route knowledge, and public transportation skills. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that pedestrian and public transit interventions have the potential to improve the participation and quality of life of children and youth with disabilities. More rigorous, theoretically informed interventions, using standardized measures are needed to enhance pedestrian and transit training skills among youth with disabilities. Implications for rehabilitation Travel training interventions have the potential to effectively support youth with disabilities in learning pedestrian and public transportation navigation skills. Clinicians and educators should encourage youth with disabilities to participate in travel training programs enhance their independence skills and participation in the community. Clinicians, educators, and program managers can help to build relevant content for travel training programs and connect youth to programs."
Pediatric Obesity and Eating Disorders Symptoms: The Role of the Multidisciplinary Treatment. A Systematic Review.	"The prevalence of obesity in children/adolescents has increased worldwide during the past 30 years, becoming a significant public health concern; prevention, and management of pediatric obesity onset is one of the most critical public health goals for both industrialized and developing countries. Pediatric obesity has been identified as a risk factor for various psychopathologies, including eating disorders (ED). Although it has been demonstrated that a comprehensive multidisciplinary treatment (MT), with small steps and practical approaches to lifestyle change, can be an effective treatment for children and adolescents with obesity, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review investigating the effect of MT on the development, progression or decrease of ED symptoms (EDS) in this target population. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched (last search on 18 February 2019) according to a predetermined search strategy, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Guidelines and Statement. Original studies published in English examining the effect of MT on pediatric overweight/obesity, paying particularly attention at the development of EDS, were eligible for inclusion. Seven hundred and forty-four records have been identified; nine articles with study quality ranging from weak to moderate have been included. MTs were heterogeneous in nature including length, number, frequency and type of sessions, parent-involvement and use of technology, besides several psychometric questionnaires were used to screen for EDS, since there are no standardized criteria. In 3 studies there was a significant decrease in external and emotional eating and in four studies a significant increase in restraint eating post MT. Two studies found a significant decrease of binge eating symptoms and other two studies showed an improvement of self-perception, weight, and shape concern. A statistical significant decrease in BMI, BMIz, BMISDS, and adjusted BMI was observed after all MTs, except one. A narrative summary of the evidences reported highlighted the positive impact of MT on the EDS. Moreover, since weight loss post MTs was not necessarily related to EDS, clinicians should also look for the presence of EDS and treat them accordingly."
Peering into the literature: A systematic review of the roles of people who inject drugs in harm reduction initiatives	"BACKGROUND: People who inject drugs have been central to the development of harm reduction initiatives. Referred to as peer workers, peer helpers, or natural helpers, people with lived experience of drug use leverage their personal knowledge and skills to deliver harm reduction services. Addressing a gap in the literature, this systematic review focuses on the roles of people who inject drugs in harm reduction initiatives, how programs are organized, and obstacles and facilitators to engaging people with lived experience in harm reduction programs, in order to inform practice and future research. METHODS: This systematic review included searches for both peer reviewed and gray literature. All titles and abstracts were screened by two reviewers. A structured data extraction tool was developed and utilized to systematically code information concerning peer roles and participation, program characteristics, obstacles, and facilitators. RESULTS: On the basis of specific inclusion criteria 164 documents were selected, with 127 peer-reviewed and 37 gray literature references. Data extraction identified key harm reduction program characteristics and forms of participation including 36 peer roles grouped into five categories, as well as obstacles and facilitators at systemic, organizational, and individual levels. CONCLUSIONS: Research on harm reduction programs that involve people with lived experience can help us better understand these approaches and demonstrate their value. Current evidence provides good descriptive content but the field lacks agreed-upon approaches to documenting the ways peer workers contribute to harm reduction initiatives. Implications and ten strategies to better support peer involvement in harm reduction programs are identified. Copyright ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
Perceived barriers to smoking cessation in selected vulnerable groups: a systematic review of the qualitative and quantitative literature	"OBJECTIVES: To identify barriers that are common and unique to six selected vulnerable groups: low socioeconomic status; Indigenous; mental illness and substance abuse; homeless; prisoners; and at-risk youth. DESIGN: A systematic review was carried out to identify the perceived barriers to smoking cessation within six vulnerable groups. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycInfo were searched using keywords and MeSH terms from each database's inception published prior to March 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that provided either qualitative or quantitative (ie, longitudinal, cross-sectional or cohort surveys) descriptions of self-reported perceived barriers to quitting smoking in one of the six aforementioned vulnerable groups were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. RESULTS: 65 eligible papers were identified: 24 with low socioeconomic groups, 16 with Indigenous groups, 18 involving people with a mental illness, 3 with homeless groups, 2 involving prisoners and 1 involving at-risk youth. One study identified was carried out with participants who were homeless and addicted to alcohol and/or other drugs. Barriers common to all vulnerable groups included: smoking for stress management, lack of support from health and other service providers, and the high prevalence and acceptability of smoking in vulnerable communities. Unique barriers were identified for people with a mental illness (eg, maintenance of mental health), Indigenous groups (eg, cultural and historical norms), prisoners (eg, living conditions), people who are homeless (eg, competing priorities) and at-risk youth (eg, high accessibility of tobacco). CONCLUSIONS: Vulnerable groups experience common barriers to smoking cessation, in addition to barriers that are unique to specific vulnerable groups. Individual-level, community-level and social network-level interventions are priority areas for future smoking cessation interventions within vulnerable groups.

Perceived Facilitators and Barriers to Interventions Aimed at Reducing Unintended Pregnancies among Adolescents in Low and Middle Income (Developing) Countries: a Systematic Review of Qualitative Evidence.	"BACKGROUND: Adolescent pregnancies are most often the result of sexual risk taking. Such pregnancies are in themselves ""risks"" perpetuating other adverse social outcomes on the adolescents who go through such pregnancies. Of the close to 14 million births among adolescents each year, between one-third and two-thirds are unplanned. Unplanned pregnancies coupled with societal restrictions result in adolescents opting for abortions under unsafe conditions. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to present the best available evidence on perceived facilitators and barriers to successful outcomes of programs aimed at reducing pregnancies among adolescents in low and middle income countries. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Persons aged between 10 and 19 years residing in low and middle income countries, but during the review process, those up to 25 years, adults and opinion leaders were included.Perceived facilitators and barriers to interventions aimed at reducing pregnancies among adolescents in developing countries.The review considered studies that used qualitative study designs, including but not limited to: phenomenology, grounded theory, action research, narrative studies, descriptive studies, ethnographies, cultural studies, behavioural studies, case studies and feminist research. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy aimed to find both published and unpublished studies in English over the period of January, 1960 to December, 2010. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Critical appraisal of papers was conducted using standardized tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute by two independent reviewers. DATA COLLECTION: Data was extracted using standardized tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA SYNTHESIS: Findings were synthesized on the basis of similarity of meaning using software from the Joanna Briggs Institute. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in the review which generated 103 findings, grouped into 22 categories and then further grouped into 11 synthesized findings, based on similarity of meaning. Seventeen categories (eight synthesized findings) described perceived barriers and five categories (three synthesized findings) described perceived facilitators. CONCLUSIONS: Synthesized findings on both the barriers and facilitators encompassed adolescent, parental, community, health facility, care providers, school environment and societal contributing factors. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Further research should be conducted into the following."
Perceptions of Patients and Physiotherapists on Patient Participation: A Narrative Synthesis of Qualitative Studies	"Background and Purpose Patient participation is nowadays considered important for high quality patient care. Although the literature on health care professions provides some insights into this topic, specific aspects in the field of physiotherapy are less known. The objective of this review was to investigate how patients and physiotherapists perceive patient participation, especially in regards to what it means for them and the role patients play during physiotherapy treatment sessions. Methods We used a narrative synthesis of qualitative studies. We conducted a systematic search in six databases using a set of key words, extracted relevant data, performed quality assessment and synthesized findings from the selected studies. Results Out of 160 studies, 11 were retained. Two main themes emerged: the conceptualization of patient participation and the patients' role preferences. Patient participation included various activities including goal setting, information exchange, decision-making and exercise training and often influenced the power relation between patient and physiotherapist. Patients' willingness to participate varied, and they often did not play their desired role. Conclusions Patients and physiotherapists perceived participation to be valuable yet challenging. Problems of conceptualization, power inequalities, lack of health professionals' skills and lack of the right attitude to share power and responsibility from both sides were some of the barriers that impeded optimal participation.

Perceptions of Smartphone User-Centered Mobile Health Tracking Apps Across Various Chronic Illness Populations: An Integrative Review	"Purpose This integrative review presents a synthesis of the current qualitative research addressing the motivating factors, usability, and experiences of mobile health tracking applications (apps) across various chronic disease populations. Design Integrative review of the literature. Methods Databases used to conduct this integrative review included: PubMed Plus, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Google Scholar, Science Direct, and EBSCO megafile. The following search terms were used in all five databases: smartphone apps, apps, mHealth, eHealth, mobile health apps, health tracking apps, user-centered apps, wireless technology, engagement, qualitative, and usability. Findings The initial literature review yielded 689 results. Once inclusion and exclusion criteria were employed, 11 studies met the criteria set forth for this review. The reviewed studies provided insight into users' perceptions, experiences, and motivations to incorporate smartphone mobile health apps into their daily lives when living with chronic illnesses. Conclusions This review indicates the growing interest in user-centered mobile health tracking apps, but with little understanding of motivating factors that foster sustained app use. Mobile health tracking apps targeted to users with chronic conditions need to have a high level of usability in order to motivate users to sustain engagement with their mobile health tracking app. Clinical Relevance User-centered mobile health tracking app technology is being used with increasing frequency to potentially provide individualized support to chronic illness populations."
"Perceptions, experiences and preferences of patients receiving a clinician's touch during intimate care and procedures: a qualitative systematic review"	"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice frequently involves the practitioner touching patients' bodies in areas that are highly personal. If inappropriately performed, such intimate touch may result in much anxiety, confusion and misinterpretation. Examination of evidence is necessary to guide practice in this area to mitigate risks and foster optimal clinician-patient relations and care. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this qualitative systematic review was to identify and synthesize findings on the perceptions, experiences and preferences of patients receiving a clinician's touch during intimate care and procedures INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: The current review considered studies that included patients who had received a clinician's touch during intimate care and procedures. PHENOMENA OF INTEREST: The current review considered qualitative studies that evaluated patients' perceptions, experiences and preferences of a clinician's touch during intimate care and procedures. TYPES OF STUDIES: The current review considered studies that collected qualitative data and included studies using designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research, qualitative description, focus group methodology and feminist research. In the absence of research studies, other text such as opinion papers and reports were considered. CONTEXT: The current review considered studies that included patients' perceptions, experiences and preferences of a clinician's touch during intimate care and procedures. Intimate care is likely to occur in any clinical setting where patients need assistance with personal care, where physical examinations occur, or in settings were gynecologic, genitourinary, lower intestinal, dermatologic, cardiac or other procedures involving highly personal areas of the body are performed. SEARCH STRATEGY: A three-step search strategy was used to find published and unpublished studies in English from 1970 to 2016, searching various databases which included searches of reference lists of studies selected for appraisal. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Included studies were assessed for methodological quality independently by two reviewers using the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI) prior to inclusion. Of the two studies included in the review, one did not discuss ontological and epistemological assumptions, and the other did not include the personal assumptions and role of the researcher. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted using the data extraction tool from the JBI-QARI. The data extracted included details about the phenomenon of interest, populations and study methods. DATA SYNTHESIS: Qualitative findings were synthesized using JBI-QARI. RESULTS: Two studies were included in this review. Seven findings were organized into three categories and one synthesized finding, ""clinician respect"". The finding suggests that clients prefer engaged and meaningful communication prior to and during an intimate touch encounter, expect autonomy over their bodies and desire shared decision making relative to how and by whom intimate touch is provided. CONCLUSION: The synthesized finding from this review suggests that:More research is needed to explore the perceptions and preferences for intimate touch among diverse populations, generations, cultures and contexts. Particular exploration is needed for populations with additional vulnerabilities to misunderstandings, anxiety and abuse, such as pediatric and geriatric patients, and patients with physical, mental and cognitive impairments."
Person-centred discharge education following coronary artery bypass graft: A critical review	"Aims and objectives To examine the extent that individualised education helps reduce depression and anxiety and improves self-care for people who have undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Background Individualised discharge planning is increasingly important following cardiac surgery due to recurrent admissions as well as the issue of anxiety and depression, often due to lack of preparation. The hospital to home transition is fundamental in the recovery process. Individualised education and person-centred care ensure that patients' educational needs are met. This empowers patients, increasing self-efficacy or confidence, resulting in autonomy, a smoother discharge process and avoiding postdischarge problems and rehospitalisation. Design A critical review of published peer-reviewed literature was conducted. Methods Electronic databases searched included MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library and PsychInfo 2009-2015. Results Eight articles were identified for review, and a Critical Appraisal Skills Programme framework was used to determine the quality of the papers, all of the papers focussed on coronary artery bypass graft. The designs were typically experimental or quasi-experimental with two reviews. Conclusion A greater understanding of the patients' needs allows tailored education to be provided, which promotes self-care management. This level of patient empowerment increases confidence and ultimately minimise anxiety and depression. Despite the varying teaching and learning methods associated with individualised education, patient-centred education has the potential to assist cardiac nurses in adequately preparing patients for discharge following their coronary artery bypass graft. Relevance to clinical practice Development of individualised education programmes is crucial in preparing patients for discharge. The reduction in readmission to hospital has a significant effect on already stretched resources, and the reduction in postoperative complications during the recovery period linked with depression and anxiety will have a positive effect on the individuals' ability to self-care, health and well-being."
"Person-directed, non-pharmacological interventions for sleepiness at work and sleep disturbances caused by shift work."	"Background Shift work is often associated with sleepiness and sleep disorders. Person-directed, non-pharmacological interventions may positively influence the impact of shift work on sleep, thereby improving workers' well-being, safety, and health. Objectives To assess the effects of person-directed, non-pharmacological interventions for reducing sleepiness at work and improving the length and quality of sleep between shifts for shift workers. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase, Web of Knowledge, ProQuest, PsycINFO, OpenGrey, and OSH-UPDATE from inception to August 2015. We also screened reference lists and conference proceedings and searched the World Health Organization (WHO) Trial register. We contacted experts to obtain unpublished data. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (including cross-over designs) that investigated the effect of any person-directed, non-pharmacological intervention on sleepiness on-shift or sleep length and sleep quality off-shift in shift workers who also work nights. Data collection and analysis At least two authors screened titles and abstracts for relevant studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted authors to obtain missing information. We conducted meta-analyses when pooling of studies was possible. Main results We included 17 relevant trials (with 556 review-relevant participants) which we categorised into three types of interventions: (1) various exposures to bright light (n = 10); (2) various opportunities for napping (n = 4); and (3) other interventions, such as physical exercise or sleep education (n = 3). In most instances, the studies were too heterogeneous to pool. Most of the comparisons yielded low to very low quality evidence. Only one comparison provided moderate quality evidence. Overall, the included studies' results were inconclusive. We present the results regarding sleepiness below. Authors' conclusions Given the methodological diversity of the included studies, in terms of interventions, settings, and assessment tools, their limited reporting and the very low to low quality of the evidence they present, it is not possible to determine whether shift workers' sleepiness can be reduced or if their sleep length or quality can be improved with these interventions."
Person-directed care planning in nursing homes: A scoping review	"Aim: Federal regulations require nursing homes in the United States to support residents in directing their own care rather than having their care plans developed for them without their engagement, but knowledge of person-directed approaches to care planning in nursing homes is limited. The purpose of this study was to advance understanding of person-directed care planning (PDCP). Methods: A multidisciplinary research team conducted a scoping review on individual and family involvement in care planning, including literature from a variety of care contexts. Search results were systematically screened to identify literature that addressed individual or family involvement in care planning as a primary concern, and then analysed using thematic content analysis. Results: Several themes were identified, including definitions of the concept of PDCP, essential elements of PDCP, barriers, facilitators and outcomes. The concept of PDCP is informed by multiple disciplines, including humanist philosophy, disability rights and end-of-life care. Essential elements of PDCP include knowing the person, integrating the person's goals in care planning and updating care plans as individuals' needs or preferences change. Limited time for care planning in nursing homes hinders PDCP. Facilitators include regulatory mandates and humanist social trends. Outcomes of PDCP were found to be positive (e.g., increased independence), but were inconsistently assessed across studies. Conclusion: This study offers pragmatic information that can support PDCP within nursing homes and insights for policy reform that may more effectively support PDCP. Implications for practice: These findings can be used to guide implementation of PDCP."
Personalised care planning for adults with chronic or long-term health conditions	"BACKGROUND: Personalised care planning is a collaborative process used in chronic condition management in which patients and clinicians identify and discuss problems caused by or related to the patient's condition, and develop a plan for tackling these. In essence it is a conversation, or series of conversations, in which they jointly agree goals and actions for managing the patient's condition. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of personalised care planning for adults with long-term health conditions compared to usual care (i.e. forms of care in which active involvement of patients in treatment and management decisions is not explicitly attempted or achieved). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ProQuest, clinicaltrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to July 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials and cluster-randomised trials involving adults with long-term conditions where the intervention included collaborative (between individual patients and clinicians) goal setting and action planning. We excluded studies where there was little or no opportunity for the patient to have meaningful influence on goal selection, choice of treatment or support package, or both. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two of three review authors independently screened citations for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes were effects on physical health, psychological health, subjective health status, and capabilities for self management. Secondary outcomes included effects on health-related behaviours, resource use and costs, and type of intervention. A patient advisory group of people with experience of living with long-term conditions advised on various aspects of the review, including the protocol, selection of outcome measures and emerging findings. MAIN RESULTS: We included 19 studies involving a total of 10,856 participants. Twelve of these studies focused on diabetes, three on mental health, one on heart failure, one on end-stage renal disease, one on asthma, and one on various chronic conditions. All 19 studies included components that were intended to support behaviour change among patients, involving either face-to-face or telephone support. All but three of the personalised care planning interventions took place in primary care or community settings; the remaining three were located in hospital clinics. There was some concern about risk of bias for each of the included studies in respect of one or more criteria, usually due to inadequate or unclear descriptions of research methods. Physical healthNine studies measured glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), giving a combined mean difference (MD) between intervention and control of -0.24% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.35 to -0.14), a small positive effect in favour of personalised care planning compared to usual care (moderate quality evidence).Six studies measured systolic blood pressure, a combined mean difference of -2.64 mm/Hg (95% CI -4.47 to -0.82) favouring personalised care (moderate quality evidence). The pooled results from four studies showed no significant effect on diastolic blood pressure, MD -0.71 mm/Hg (95% CI -2.26 to 0.84).We found no evidence of an effect on cholesterol (LDL-C), standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.01 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.11) (five studies) or body mass index, MD -0.11 (95% CI -0.35 to 0.13) (four studies).A single study of people with asthma reported that personalised care planning led to improvements in lung function and asthma control. Psychological healthSix studies measured depression. We were able to pool results from five of these, giving an SMD of -0.36 (95% CI -0.52 to -0.20), a small effect in favour of personalised care (moderate quality evidence). The remaining study found greater improvement in the control group than the intervention group.Four other studies used a variety of psychological measures that were conceptually different so could not be pooled. Of these, three found greater improvement for the personalised care group than the usual care group and one was too small to detect differences in outcomes. Subjective health statusTen studies used various patient-reported measures of health status (or health-related quality of life), including both generic health status measures and condition-specific ones. We were able to pool data from three studies that used the SF-36 or SF-12, but found no effect on the physical component summary score SMD 0.16 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.38) or the mental component summary score SMD 0.07 (95% CI -0.15 to 0.28) (moderate quality evidence). Of the three other studies that measured generic health status, two found improvements related to personalised care and one did not.Four studies measured condition-specific health status. The combined results showed no difference between the intervention and control groups, SMD -0.01 (95% CI -0.11 to 0.10) (moderate quality evidence). Self-management capabilitiesNine studies looked at the effect of personalised care on self-management capabilities using a variety of outcome measures, but they focused primarily on self efficacy. We were able to pool results from five studies that measured self efficacy, giving a small positive result in favour of personalised care planning: SMD 0.25 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.43) (moderate quality evidence).A further five studies measured other attributes that contribute to self-management capabilities. The results from these were mixed: two studies found evidence of an effect on patient activation, one found an effect on empowerment, and one found improvements in perceived interpersonal support. Other outcomesPooled data from five studies on exercise levels showed no effect due to personalised care planning, but there was a positive effect on people's self-reported ability to carry out self-care activities: SMD 0.35 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.52).We found no evidence of adverse effects due to personalised care planning.The effects of personalised care planning were greater when more stages of the care planning cycle were completed, when contacts between patients and health professionals were more frequent, and when the patient's usual clinician was involved in the process. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Personalised care planning leads to improvements in certain indicators of physical and psychological health status, and people's capability to self-manage their condition when compared to usual care. The effects are not large, but they appear greater when the intervention is more comprehensive, more intensive, and better integrated into routine care."
Pharmacists' involvement in and attitudes toward pharmacy practice research: A systematic review of the literature	"BACKGROUND: The role of pharmacists in health care has evolved toward patient-centered care. Pharmacy practice-based research is essential to the advancement of practice; however, literature addressing attitudes and involvement of pharmacists in practice research indicates reluctance among them. An account of studies undertaken thus far is warranted. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to summarize and evaluate the views and attitudes of pharmacists regarding their involvement in pharmacy practice research as well as the barriers and enablers to such research. METHODS: A systematic review of original studies published mainly in MEDLINE, PubMed, EBSCO, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, and Google Scholar was conducted to identify published studies that report pharmacists' attitudes and involvement in research as well as perceived facilitators and barriers. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers using a standardized data abstraction tool. RESULTS: Fifteen studies utilizing questionnaire-based surveys, focus groups or interviews were identified and included in the review. The majority of studies (10 of 15) involved community pharmacists, while only 6 involved hospital pharmacists. Studies were mostly conducted in the UK (5 of 15), followed by Australia and Canada (3 of 15 each). Early studies focused on pharmacists' attitudes on practice-based research, but most recently there was attention on practice-based research networks (PBRNs). Pharmacists' awareness, interest and willingness to participate in practice research, their actual involvement in research projects, and positive attitude toward research have increased over time. Pharmacists generally believed that practice-based research was needed for professional development of pharmacy and agreed with the importance of research to support evidence-based practice and to improve the quality of patient care and outcomes. The most commonly reported barriers to participation in research across the reviewed studies were: lack of time and workload; insufficient or lack of funds; and lack of research knowledge, training, mentorship and support. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists recognize the value of research in advancing pharmacy practice and indicate their willingness to be involved in independent research and in PBRNs. Lack of time, training and support were identified as the greatest limitations to participation in practice research. These findings have important implications on promoting research capacity building through the development of PBRNs involving academic and pharmacy practitioners as well as informal research training programs.

Pharmacologic treatment of depression in the elderly	"OBJECTIVE: To discuss pharmacologic treatment of depression in the elderly, including choice of antidepressants, titration of dose, monitoring of response and side effects, and treatment of unresponsive cases. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: The 2006 Canadian Coalition for Seniors' Mental Health guideline on the assessment and treatment of depression was used as a primary source. To identify articles published since the guideline, MEDLINE was searched from 2007 to 2012 using the terms depression, treatment, drug therapy, and elderly. MAIN MESSAGE: The goal of treatment should be remission of symptoms. Improvement of symptoms can be monitored by identifying patient goals or by use of a clinical tool such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Treatment should be considered in 3 phases: an acute treatment phase to achieve remission of symptoms, a continuation phase to prevent recurrence of the same episode of illness (relapse), and a maintenance (prophylaxis) phase to prevent future episodes (recurrence). Initial dosing should be half of the usual adult starting dose and be titrated regularly until the patient responds, until the maximum dose is reached, or until side effects limit further increases. Common side effects of medications include falls, nausea, dizziness, headaches, and, less commonly, hyponatremia and QT interval changes. Strategies for switching or augmenting antidepressants are discussed. Older patients should be treated for at least a year from when clinical improvement is noted, and those with recurrent depression or severe symptoms should continue treatment indefinitely. Treatment of specific situations such as severe depression or depression with psychosis is discussed, including the use of electroconvulsive therapy. Criteria for referral to geriatric psychiatry are provided; however, many family physicians do not have easy access to this resource or to other nonpharmacologic clinical strategies. CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of pharmacologic treatment of depression is not substantially affected by age. Identification of depression, choice of appropriate treatment, titration of medications, monitoring of side effects, and adequate duration of treatment will improve outcomes for older patients."
Pharmacopuncture for asthma: A systematic review and a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.	"Introduction Pharmacopuncture, a new type of acupuncture treatment in traditional East Asian medicine combining acupuncture and the injection of herbal medicine, is widely used for asthma in China and Korea. However, the evidence is equivocal. This systematic review aims to summarize and evaluate the efficacy of pharmacopuncture for asthma. Methods Eleven electronic databases and five journals were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of pharmacopuncture for asthma were included. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Data analysis was conducted using RevMan Rsoftware (version 5.3). Results Eighteen RCTs involving 1624 patients with asthma were included for qualitative synthesis. Data from 12 RCTs were used for meta-analysis. There were various types of pharmacopuncture used. Use of Chuankezhi pharmacopuncture (CKZ PA) and Huangqi pharmacopuncture (HQ PA) usually overlapped among included studies. Subgroup analysis was conducted after dividing experimental groups into two groups: CKZ PA and HQ PA. When added to conventional therapy, pharmacopuncture significantly improved the response rate (RR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.12-1.24, I2 = 0%), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (SMD = 1.31, 95% CI: 0.59-2.03, P = 0.0004, I2 = 94%) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) (SMD = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.22-1.01, P = 0.002, I2 = 76%). Conclusions Evidence of pharmacopuncture efficacy for asthma is encouraging, but not conclusive, because of the low methodological qualities, substantial heterogeneity, and small sample sizes of the examined studies. Further research using large-scale, rigorous study designs should be conducted."
Photovoice and Persons With Physical Disabilities: A Scoping Review of the Literature	"Photovoice is a group analysis method often affiliated with participatory action research (PAR). It has become increasingly popular in qualitative research with people with physical disabilities. This article details the results of a study that sought to understand the scope of the literature related to how photovoice is conducted with people with physical disabilities. We performed a scoping review related to use of photovoice in physical disabilities research. We identified 20 articles that featured diverse participants with physical disabilities and demonstrated a range of approaches to data collection, analysis, and dissemination. Nearly all of the articles identified used photovoice to study physical accessibility/navigation of space. Although a majority of selected articles purported to use PAR approaches, many articles demonstrated research that may not be as participatory as presumed. Based on the findings, we provide suggestions for photovoice studies that will ensure full and meaningful participation of members involved."
Photovoice in mental illness research: A review and recommendations	"In the past few decades, photovoice research has gained prominence, providing context rich insights through participants' photographs and narratives. Emergent within the field of photovoice research have been health studies embracing diverse illness issues. The goal of this scoping review article was to describe the use of photovoice in mental illness, paying particular attention to the following: (1) the study design and methods, (2) empirical findings, and (3) dissemination strategies. Nine qualitative studies (seven drawing from primary and two secondary analyses) featuring diverse approaches to analysis of data comprising individual and/or focus group interviews using participant-produced photographs were included in the review. Described were participant's experiences of living with mental illness and/or substance overuse, including feelings of loneliness and being marginalized, along with their support care needs (e.g. physical, emotional, and spiritual) to garner self-confidence, respite, and/or recovery. Empirically, the reviewed articles confirmed the value of participant-produced photographs for obtaining in-depth understandings about individual's mental illness experiences while a focus on stigma and recovery was prominent. In terms of dissemination, while most of the published articles shared some participants' photographs and narratives, less evident were strategies to actively engage the public or policymakers with the images. Recommendations for future photovoice research include conducting formal analyses of participant photographs and strategically lobbying policymakers and raising public awareness through virtual and ""in person"" photo exhibitions while de-stigmatizing and affirming the experiences of those who are challenged by mental illness.

Physiotherapy for Ankylosing Spondylitis: Systematic Review and a Proposed Rehabilitation Protocol.	"Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease with gradual onset, largely affecting the axial skeleton. As leads to varying degrees of restricted spinal mobility, pain and loss of functional capacity. Rehabilitation, especially physiotherapy and exercises, are considered integral components of its management. Various rehabilitation modalities are available for the benefit of individuals with AS, but a sequenced protocol has not been reported. A scientific review was performed using the following search engines: MEDLINE (Pubmed), COCHRANE Library and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). Studies, which had at least one of the groups receiving rehabilitation, and the major outcomes studied including pain, stiffness, mobility (spine and chest wall) and physical function (disease activity, ADL, QOL and global function) were selected. A total of 28 studies were shortlisted for the review which included a total of 1926 subjects with AS. The review of literature showed that individuals with AS had beneficial effects from exercise programmes compared to no exercise. Patient education, active involvement and motivation of individuals with AS played an important role in the overall treatment outcomes. Based on the review, a four-phase sequenced rehabilitation protocol has been laid down for the benefit of individuals with AS.

"Place for being, doing, becoming and belonging: A meta-synthesis exploring the role of place in mental health recovery."	"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The role of place in mental health recovery was investigated by synthesizing qualitative research on this topic. METHODS: Using a meta-ethnographic approach, twelve research papers were selected, their data extracted, coded and synthesized. FINDINGS: Place for doing, being, becoming and belonging emerged as central mechanisms through which place impacts recovery. Several material, social, natural and temporal characteristics appear to enable or constrain the potential of places to support recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of place on recovery is multi-faceted. The multidimensional interactions between people, place and recovery can inform recovery-oriented practice. Further research is required to uncover the role of place in offering opportunities for active engagement, social connection and community participation. Crown Copyright ¬© 2018.

Pornography Addiction in Adults: A Systematic Review of Definitions and Reported Impact	"INTRODUCTION: Self-perceived pornography addiction (SPPA) has increasingly emerged as a concept in research and popular culture, and commentators warn of the reported negative impact that it has. Despite this, ""pornography or porn addiction"" is not a formally recognized disorder and there is disagreement among researchers regarding its definition or even its existence. Therefore, how SPPA is operationalized often varies, and this is likely to influence the conclusions made about the impact of SPPA. AIM: This review aimed to examine what the supposed impact of SPPA is, and how the concept is operationalized. METHODS: A systematic review of quantitative and qualitative peer-reviewed journal articles was conducted. The following databases were searched up to November 2015: CINAHL (2001-2015), Embase (1974-2015), Medline (1946-2015), PsychARTICLES (1980), and PsychInfo (1806-2015). Terms used were porn*, sexually explicit material, SEM, erotic*, nonparaphilic, cyberpornography, addict*, problematic, excess*, compul*, impul*, impact, effec*, behav*, and cause. An asterisk after a term means that all terms that begin with that root were included in the search. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A review of the the current literature pertaining to SPPA and its reported impact. RESULTS: We found that SPPA is most frequently operationalized as excessive pornography use and negative consequences. As a result, researchers tended to focus on the frequency of pornography use and related impact as determinants of SPPA. SPPA is reported to affect users and their partners in similar ways, such as increased feelings of isolation and relationship breakdowns. However, we found some methodologic limitations of the primary studies, which limit the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn. Limitations include the lack of representative samples and inadequate measurements of SPPA and its impact. CONCLUSION: There still exist a debate regarding the definition and etiology of SPPA as distinct from self-perceived sex addiction. As such, the research landscape is shaped by different theoretical perspectives. Without evidence to suggest one theoretical position as superior to another, clinicians might be at risk of recommending treatment that is in line with their theoretical perspective (or personal biases) but at odds with the motivations driving an individual to engage in particular sexual behaviors. In light of these findings, the review concludes with recommendations for future research. Copyright ¬© 2016 International Society for Sexual Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Practitioner review: Engaging fathers--recommendations for a game change in parenting interventions based on a systematic review of the global evidence	"BACKGROUND: Despite robust evidence of fathers' impact on children and mothers, engaging with fathers is one of the least well-explored and articulated aspects of parenting interventions. It is therefore critical to evaluate implicit and explicit biases manifested in current approaches to research, intervention, and policy. METHODS: We conducted a systematic database and a thematic hand search of the global literature on parenting interventions. Studies were selected from Medline, Psychinfo, SSCI, and Cochrane databases, and from gray literature on parenting programs, using multiple search terms for parent, father, intervention, and evaluation. We tabulated single programs and undertook systematic quality coding to review the evidence base in terms of the scope and nature of data reporting. RESULTS: After screening 786 nonduplicate records, we identified 199 publications that presented evidence on father participation and impact in parenting interventions. With some notable exceptions, few interventions disaggregate 'father' or 'couple' effects in their evaluation, being mostly driven by a focus on the mother-child dyad. We identified seven key barriers to engaging fathers in parenting programs, pertaining to cultural, institutional, professional, operational, content, resource, and policy considerations in their design and delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Barriers to engaging men as parents work against father inclusion as well as father retention, and undervalue coparenting as contrasted with mothering. Robust evaluations of father participation and father impact on child or family outcomes are stymied by the ways in which parenting interventions are currently designed, delivered, and evaluated. Three key priorities are to engage fathers and coparenting couples successfully, to disaggregate process and impact data by fathers, mothers, and coparents, and to pay greater attention to issues of reach, sustainability, cost, equity, and scale-up. Clarity of purpose with respect to gender-differentiated and coparenting issues in the design, delivery, and evaluation of parenting programs will constitute a game change in this field.

Practitioner Review: Involving young people with callous unemotional traits in treatment--does it work? A systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents with callous unemotional (CU) traits are at risk of severe and persistent antisocial behavior. It is commonly assumed that these children are difficult to treat but it has been proposed that they may benefit from being involved in interventions that go beyond typical parent training programs. This systematic review sought to answer two previously unanswered questions: do interventions involving young people reduce levels of CU traits? Do CU traits predict the effectiveness of interventions for antisocial behavior involving young people? METHOD: Studies were included that adopted an randomized controlled trial, controlled or open trial design and that had examined whether treatment was related to reductions in CU traits or whether CU traits predicted or moderated treatment effectiveness. RESULTS: Treatments used a range of approaches, including behavioral therapy, emotion recognition training, and multimodal interventions. 4/7 studies reported reductions in CU traits following treatment. There was a mixed pattern of findings in 15 studies that examined whether CU traits predicted treatment outcomes following interventions for antisocial behavior. In 7/15 studies, CU traits were associated with worse outcomes, although three of these studies did not provide data on baseline antisocial behavior, making it difficult to evaluate whether children with high CU traits had shown improvements relative to their own behavioral baseline, despite having the worst behavioral outcomes overall. CU traits did not predict outcomes in 7/15 studies. Finally, a single study reported that CU traits predicted an overall increased response to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the evidence supports the idea that children with CU traits do show reductions in both their CU traits and their antisocial behavior, but typically begin treatment with poorer premorbid functioning and can still end with higher levels of antisocial behavior. However, there is considerable scope to build on the current evidence base. Copyright ¬© 2015 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health."
Preparing medical students to facilitate lifestyle changes with obese patients: A systematic review of the literature.	"PURPOSE: Doctors will increasingly encounter opportunities to support obese patients in lifestyle change efforts, but the extent to which medical schools prepare their students for this challenge is unknown. Further, despite evidence indicating theory-based techniques are effective in facilitating patients' behavioral changes, the methods taught to medical students and the means of content delivery are unclear. The authors reviewed the literature to investigate how effective educational interventions are in preparing medical students to facilitate lifestyle changes with obese patients. METHOD: The authors systematically searched Excerpta Medica (EMBASE), PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Scopus for educational interventions on obesity management for medical students published in English between January 1990 and November 2010 and matching PICOS (Population, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes, Study design) inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Results of a narrative synthesis are presented. Of 1,680 studies initially identified, 36 (2%) full-text articles were reviewed, and 12 (1%) were included in the final dataset. Eleven (92%) of these studies had quantitative designs; of these, 7 (64%) did not include control groups. Nine (75%) of the 12 studies were atheoretical, and 4 (33%) described behavior management strategies. Despite positive reported outcomes regarding intervention evaluations, procedures to control for bias were infrequently reported, and conclusions were often unsupported by evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this systematic review revealed data highly susceptible to bias; thus, intervention efficacy could not be determined. Additionally, evidence-based strategies to support patients' obesity-related behavior changes were not applied to these studies, and thus it remains unknown how best to equip medical students for this task."
Prevalence of limited health literacy among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review.	"BACKGROUND: Health literacy (HL) skills are essential to enable self-management and shared decision-making in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Limited HL in these patients is associated with poorer outcomes. It is not clear what the burden of limited HL in patients with T2DM across countries and what factors influence it. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017056150). We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and ERIC for articles published up to January 2017. Articles that measured HL levels in adult patients with T2DM; that used validated HL tools; and that were reported in English were included. Two reviewers assessed studies for eligibility and quality, and extracted the data. Prevalence of limited HL is calculated from the number of patients with less than adequate HL over the total number of patients with T2DM in the study. Meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis were conducted using the Open Meta-analyst software. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies involving 13,457 patients with T2DM from seven countries were included. In total, seven different HL measurement tools were used. The prevalence of limited HL ranged from 7.3% to 82%, lowest in Switzerland and the highest in Taiwan. Meta-regression analysis of all included studies showed the country of study (p<0.001), HL tool used (p = 0.002), and the country's region (p<0.001) contributed to the variation findings. Thirteen studies in the USA measured functional HL. The pooled prevalence of inadequate functional HL among patients with T2DM in the USA was 28.9% (95% CI: 20.4-37.3), with high heterogeneity (I2 = 97.9%, p <0.001). Studies were done in the community as opposed to a hospital or primary care (p = 0.005) and populations with education level lower than high school education (p = 0.009) reported a higher prevalence of limited HL. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of limited HL in patients with T2DM varied widely between countries, HL tools used and the country's region. Pooled prevalence showed nearly one in three patients with T2DM in the USA had limited functional HL. Interactions with healthcare providers and educational attainment were associated with reported of prevalence in the USA."
Preventable obstetrical interventions: how many caesarean sections can be prevented in Canada?	"Public health authorities have been alarmed by the progressive rise in rates of Caesarean section in Canada, approaching one birth in three in several provinces. We aimed therefore to consider what were preventable obstetrical interventions in women with a low-risk pregnancy and to propose an analytic framework for the reduction of the rate of CS. We obtained statistical variations of CS rates over time, across regions, and within professional practices from MED-ECHO, the Quebec hospitalization database, from 1969 to 2009. Data were extracted from a recent systematic review of the cascade of obstetrical interventions to calculate the population-attributable fractions for each intervention associated with an increased probability of CS. We thereby identified expectant management (as an alternative to labour induction) and planned vaginal birth after CS as the leading strategies for potentially reducing rates of CS in women at low risk. For vaginal birth after CS, an increase to its 1995 level could lower the current CS rate of 23.2% (2009 to 2010) to 21.0%. Other alternatives to obstetrical interventions with a potential for lowering CS rates included non-pharmacological pain control methods (such as continuous support during childbirth) in addition to usual care, intermittent auscultation of the fetal heart (instead of electronic fetal monitoring), and multidisciplinary internal quality assessment audits. We believe, therefore, that the concept of preventable CS is supported by empirical evidence, and we identified realistic strategies to maintain a CS rate in Quebec near 20%.; Publisher: Les autorites en matiere de sante publique ont ete alarmees par la hausse graduelle des taux de cesarienne (CS) au Canada (pres d'une naissance sur trois dans plusieurs provinces). Nous avons donc cherche a identifier les interventions obstetricales qui pouvaient etre evitees chez les femmes qui connaissent une grossesse les exposant a de faibles risques, ainsi qu'a proposer un cadre analytique pour la reduction du taux de CS. Les variations statistiques, entre 1969 et 2009, des taux de CS avec le temps, d'une region a l'autre et en fonction des pratiques professionnelles ont ete tirees de MED-ECHO (la base de donnees sur l'hospitalisation au Quebec). Des donnees ont ete tirees d'une recente analyse systematique de la cascade d'interventions obstetricales en vue de calculer les fractions etiologiques du risque pour chacune des interventions associees a une probabilite accrue de CS. Nous avons ainsi identifie la prise en charge non interventionniste (a titre de solution de rechange au declenchement du travail) et l'accouchement vaginal planifie apres CS comme etant les principales strategies pouvant permettre la reduction des taux de CS chez les femmes exposees a de faibles risques. Pour ce qui est de l'accouchement vaginal apres CS, une hausse jusqu'a son niveau de 1995 pourrait faire passer le taux actuel de CS de 23,2 % (de 2009 a 2010) a 21,0 %. Parmi les solutions de rechange aux interventions obstetricales qui presentent le potentiel d'abaisser les taux de CS, on trouvait les methodes non pharmacologiques de maitrise de la douleur (comme l'offre d'un soutien continu pendant l'accouchement) s'ajoutant aux soins habituels, l'auscultation intermittente du coeur foetal (plutot que le monitorage electronique du foetus) et les audits internes multidisciplinaires de la qualite. Nous estimons donc que le concept de la CS evitable est soutenu par des donnees empiriques et nous avons identifie des strategies realistes permettant d'assurer le maintien, au Quebec, d'un taux de CS se situant pres de 20 %.; Language: French"
"Preventing and treating women""s postpartum depression: A qualitative systematic review on partner-inclusive interventions"	"Partner-related factors associated with the occurrence of Postpartum Depression (PPD) may justify the partner""s inclusion in preventive and treatment approaches. The aim of this qualitative systematic review was to synthesize the literature on partner-inclusive interventions designed to prevent or treat postpartum depression (PPD) in women. In accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, the systematic search of studies published between 1967 and May 2015 in PsycINFO and PubMed identified 26 studies that met the inclusion criteria, which reported on 24 interventions. The following partner parameters were analyzed: participation type, session content, mental health assessment, attendance assessment, and the effects of partner""s participation on the women""s response to the interventions. Total participation by the partner was mostly reported in the prevention studies, whereas partial participation was reported in the treatment studies. The session content was mostly based on psychoeducation about PPD and parenthood, coping strategies to facilitate the transition to parenthood such as the partner""s emotional and instrumental support, and problem-solving and communication skills. Some benefits perceived by the couples underscore the relevance of the partner""s inclusion in PPD interventions. However, the scarce information about the partner""s attendance and the associated effects on the women""s intervention outcomes, along with methodological limitations of the studies, made it difficult to determine if the partner""s participation was associated with the intervention""s efficacy. Conclusions about the clinical value of including partners in PPD interventions are still limited. More research is warranted to better inform health policy strategies.

Primary care patients' perspectives of barriers and enablers of primary prevention and health promotion-a meta-ethnographic synthesis.	"BACKGROUND: Primary care (PC) patients have difficulties in committing to and incorporating primary prevention and health promotion (PP&HP) activities into their long-term care. We aimed to re-interpret, for the first time, qualitative findings regarding factors affecting PC patients' acceptance of PP&HP activities. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A meta-ethnographic synthesis was generated following electronic and manual searches that retrieved 29 articles. Papers were reviewed and translated to produce a re-interpretation of the extracted concepts. The factors affecting PC patients' receptiveness to PP&HP activities were framed in a four-level ecological model (intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional and environment and society). Intrapersonal factors (patients' beliefs/attitudes, knowledge, skills, self-concept, motivation and resources) were the most numerous, with almost 25 different factors. Public health education to modify erroneous beliefs and values regarding PP&HP could encourage a transition to healthier lifestyles. Health care professionals' abilities to communicate and involve patients in the decision-making process can act as facilitators. Biopsychosocial training (with emphasis on communication skills) for health professionals must start with undergraduates. Increased consultation time, the use of reminders, follow-up visits and tools for communicating risk and motivating patients could be applied at the intrapersonal level. Collaborative care involving other health professionals (nutritionists or psychotherapists) and family and community stakeholders (teachers or gym trainers) was important in developing healthier habits. Patients also cited barriers related to the built environment and socioeconomic difficulties that highlighted the need for policies promoting social justice and equity. Encouraging PP&HP using social marketing strategies and regulating media to control its impact on health were also cited. Only the perspectives of PC patients in the context of chronic conditions were considered thus limiting extrapolation to other contexts. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors affect PP&HP. This must be taken into account when designing PP&HP activities if they are to be successfully implemented and maintained in routine practice."
Priorities and challenges for a palliative approach to care for rural indigenous populations: A scoping review	"We carried out a scoping review to identify key priorities and challenges relevant to rural Indigenous palliative care stated in existing literature. Our scoping review activities followed Arskey and O'Malley's principles for conducting a scoping review. We included peer-reviewed literature from MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE that included a discussion of Indigenous populations, palliative care, and rural settings, and did not use date limits. The literature search was conducted in April 2016, and the retrieved literature was screened for relevance and appropriateness April 2016ÄìMarch of 2017. In addition to the academic literature, a scan of the grey literature was conducted in March 2017. The retrieved grey literature was screened for relevance and reviewed by a team from a provincial health authority serving Indigenous peoples to ensure relevance in a rural BC setting. Once reviewed for relevance and appropriateness, we added four reports to supplement our analysis. Ultimately, 44 peer-reviewed articles and 4 pieces of grey literature met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Our analysis revealed several challenges and priorities relevant to rural Indigenous palliative care. Key challenges included: (i) environmental and contextual issues; (ii) institutional barriers; and (iii) interpersonal dynamics challenging client/clinician interactions. Priorities included: (i) family connections throughout the dying process; (ii) building local capacity for palliative care to provide more relevant and culturally appropriate care; and (iii) flexibility and multi-sectoral partnerships to address the complexity of day-to-day needs for patients/families. These findings point to several areas for change and action that can improve the relevance, access and comprehensiveness of palliative care programming for rural Indigenous communities in Canada and elsewhere. Taking into account of the diversity and unique strengths of each Indigenous community will be vital in developing sustainable and meaningful change.

Proactive telephone counseling for smoking cessation: Meta-analyses by recruitment channel and methodological quality.	"Background Systematic reviews demonstrated that proactive telephone counseling increases smoking cessation rates. However, these reviews did not differentiate studies by recruitment channel, did not adequately assess methodological quality, and combined different measures of abstinence. Methods Twenty-four randomized controlled trials published before December 31, 2008, included seven of active recruitment, 16 of passive recruitment, and one of mixed recruitment. We rated methodological quality on selection bias, study design, confounders, blinding, data collection methods, withdrawals, and dropouts, according to the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. We conducted random effects meta-analysis to pool the results according to abstinence type and follow-up time for studies overall and segregated by recruitment channel, and methodological quality. The level of statistical heterogeneity was quantified by I2. All statistical tests were two-sided.ResultsMethodological quality ratings indicated two strong, 10 moderate, and 12 weak studies. Overall, compared with self-help materials or no intervention control groups, proactive telephone counseling had a statistically significantly greater effect on point prevalence abstinence (nonsmoking at follow-up or abstinent for at least 24 hours, 7 days before follow-up) at 6-9 months (relative risk RR] = 1.26, 95% confidence interval CI] = 1.11 to 1.43, P . All statistical tests were two-sided.ResultsMethodological quality ratings indicated two strong, 10 moderate, and 12 weak studies. Overall, compared with self-help materials or no intervention control groups, proactive telephone counseling had a statistically significantly greater effect on point prevalence abstinence (nonsmoking at follow-up or abstinent for at least 24 hours, 7 days before follow-up) at 6-9 months (relative risk RR] = 1.26, 95% confidence interval CI] = 1.11 to 1.43, P 2 = 21.4%) but not at 12-15 months after recruitment. This pattern also emerged when studies were segregated by recruitment channel (active, passive) or methodological quality (strong/moderate, weak). Overall, the positive effect on prolonged/continuous abstinence (abstinent for 3 months or longer before follow-up) was also statistically significantly greater at 6-9 months (RR = 1.58, CI = 1.26 to 1.98, P = 21.4%) but not at 12-15 months after recruitment. This pattern also emerged when studies were segregated by recruitment channel (active, passive) or methodological quality (strong/moderate, weak). Overall, the positive effect on prolonged/continuous abstinence (abstinent for 3 months or longer before follow-up) was also statistically significantly greater at 6-9 months (RR = 1.58, CI = 1.26 to 1.98, P 2 = 49.1%) and 12-18 months after recruitment (RR = 1.40, CI = 1.23 to 1.60, P = 49.1%) and 12-18 months after recruitment (RR = 1.40, CI = 1.23 to 1.60, P 2 = 18.5%). Conclusions With the exception of point prevalence abstinence in the long term, these data support previous results showing that proactive telephone counseling has a positive impact on smoking cessation. Proactive telephone counseling increased prolonged/continuous abstinence long term for both actively and passively recruited smokers. ¬© 2011 The Author."
Promises and Perils of Group Clinics for Young People Living With Diabetes: A Realist Review.	"Group clinics are becoming popular as a new care model in diabetes care. This evidence synthesis, using realist review methodology, examined the role of group clinics in meeting the complex needs of young people living with diabetes. Following Realist And Meta-narrative Evidence Synthesis-Evolving Standards (RAMESES) quality standards, we conducted a systematic search across 10 databases. A total of 131 articles met inclusion criteria and were analyzed to develop theoretically informed explanations of how and why group clinics could work (or not) for young people with diabetes. Models of group-based care in the literature varied significantly and incorporated different degrees of clinical and educational content. Our analysis identified four overarching principles that can be applied in different contexts to drive sustained engagement of young people in group clinics: 1) emphasizing self-management as practical knowledge; 2) developing a sense of affinity between patients; 3) providing safe, developmentally appropriate care; and 4) balancing group and individual needs. Implementation of group clinics was not always straightforward; numerous adjustments to operational and clinical processes were required to establish and deliver high-quality care. Group clinics for young people with diabetes offer the potential to complement individualized care but are not a panacea and may generate as well as solve problems.

Promoting engagement by patients and families to reduce adverse events in acute care settings: a systematic review	"INTRODUCTION: Patient-centeredness is central to healthcare. Hospitals should address patients' unique needs to improve safety and quality. Patient engagement in healthcare, which may help prevent adverse events, can be approached as an independent patient safety practice (PSP) or as part of a multifactorial PSP. OBJECTIVES: This review examines how interventions encouraging this engagement have been implemented in controlled trials. METHODS: We searched Medline, CINAHL, Embase and Cochrane from 2000 to 2012 for English language studies in hospital settings with prospective controlled designs, addressing the effectiveness or implementation of patient/family engagement in PSPs. We separately reviewed interventions implemented as part of selected broader PSPs by way of example: hand hygiene, ventilator-associated pneumonia, rapid response systems and care transitions. RESULTS: Six articles met the inclusion criteria for effectiveness with a primary focus on patient engagement. We identified 12 studies implementing patient engagement as an aspect of selected broader PSPs. A number of studies relied on patients' possible function as a reporter of error to healthcare workers and patients as a source of reminders regarding safety behaviours, while others relied on direct activation of patients or families. Definitions of patient and family engagement were lacking, as well as evidence regarding the types of patients who might feel comfortable engaging with providers, and in what contexts. CONCLUSIONS: While patient engagement in safety is appealing, there is insufficient high-quality evidence informing real-world implementation. Further work should evaluate the effectiveness of interventions on patient and family engagement and clarify the added benefit of incorporating engagement in multifaceted approaches to improve patient safety endpoints. In addition, strategies to assess and overcome barriers to patients' willingness to actively engage in their care should be investigated. Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Promoting patient and family engagement through healthcare facility design: A systematic literature review	"Objectives: Summarize and synthesize published literature regarding whether the physical design of healthcare facilities affect patient and family engagement in care. Design: Systematic literature review. Data sources: EBSCOhost Health Business FullTEXT, InformeDesign, Journal of Interior Design, Journal of Health Environments Research and Design and hand search. Thesaurus, MeSH and truncated terms were used where appropriate. Review methods: A modified PICO framework was used to develop literature search strategies. Articles that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed. Results: A total of 18 articles met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Conclusions: There is a modest amount of evidence indicating that the physical environment may affect patient and family engaged care. Designs that are comfortable and foster control of one's physical and social environment, access to social support and positive distractions may enhance the patient and family experience and promote engagement in care delivery.

Provider training and experience for people living with HIV/AIDS	"BACKGROUND: The complexity of HIV/AIDS raises challenges for the effective delivery of care. It is important to ensure that the expertise and experience of care providers is of high quality. Training and experience of HIV/AIDS providers may impact not only individual patient outcomes but increasingly on health care costs as well. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to assess the effects of provider training and experience on people living with HIV/AIDS on the following outcomes: immunological (ie. viral load, CD4 count), medical (ie. mortality, proportion on antiretrovirals), psychosocial (ie. quality of life measures) and economic outcomes (ie health care costs). SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Dissertation Abstracts International (DAI), CINAHL, HealthStar, PsycInfo, PsycLit, Social Sciences Abstracts, and Sociological Abstracts from January 1, 1980 through May 29, 2009. Electronic searches were performed for abstracts from major international AIDS conferences. Reference lists from pertinent articles, books and review articles were retrieved and reviewed. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials, cohort, case control, cross-sectional studies and controlled before and after designs that examined the qualifications/training and patient volume of HIV/AIDS care of providers caring for persons known to be infected with HIV/AIDS were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for further information as required. Assessment of confounding factors was undertaken independently by two reviewers. MAIN RESULTS: A total of four studies (one randomized controlled trial, three non- randomized studies) involving 8488 people living with HIV/AIDS were included. The main findings of this review demonstrated a trend to improved outcomes when treated by a provider with more training/expertise in HIV/AIDS care in the outpatient (clinic) setting. Due to the heterogeneity of the included studies, we could not perform a meta-analysis. We present a descriptive review of the results. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate improved medical outcomes when treated by a provider with more training/expertise in HIV/AIDS care in the outpatient (clinic) setting. Since all of these studies were conducted in North America, this does not address any issues regarding the level of training/expertise required by providers working in countries with more limited resources. Practitioners who do not consider themselves 'experts' in HIV/AIDS care and care for few of these patients need to seriously consider this review which demonstrates a trend towards worse patient outcomes when receiving care by those with low caseloads/training in HIV/AIDS care."
Psychosocial interventions for patients and caregivers in the age of new communication technologies: opportunities and challenges in cancer care	"Interactive health communication technologies (IHCTs) present a new opportunity and challenge for cancer control researchers who focus on couple- and family-based psychosocial interventions. In this article, the authors first present findings from a systematic review of 8 studies that used IHCTs in psychosocial interventions with cancer patients and their caregivers. Although this research area is still in its infancy, studies suggest that it is feasible to incorporate IHCTs in such interventions, that IHCTs are generally well accepted by patients and caregivers, and that the choice of technology is largely dependent on intervention target (i.e., patient, caregiver, or both) and outcomes (e.g., decision making, symptom management, lifestyle behaviors). A major research gap has been the lack of integration of Web 2.0 technologies (e.g., social media), despite the fact that social support and communication are frequently targeted components of interventions that involve cancer patients and their caregivers. Given this, the authors next present findings from a qualitative study that they conducted to describe the different needs and preferences of 13 cancer survivors and 12 caregivers with regard to social media use. Last, the authors discuss some of the opportunities and challenges of using IHCTs in psychosocial interventions for cancer patients and their caregivers and propose directions for future research."
Psychosocial interventions for supporting women to stop smoking in pregnancy.	"Background Tobacco smoking remains one of the few preventable factors associated with complications in pregnancy, and has serious long-term implications for women and babies. Smoking in pregnancy is decreasing in high-income countries, but is strongly associated with poverty and is increasing in low- to middle-income countries. Objectives To assess the effects of smoking cessation interventions during pregnancy on smoking behaviour and perinatal health outcomes. Search methods In this sixth update, we searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (13 November 2015), checked reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted trial authors. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials, cluster-randomised trials, and quasi-randomised controlled trials of psychosocial smoking cessation interventions during pregnancy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and trial quality, and extracted data. Direct comparisons were conducted in RevMan, with meta-regression conducted in STATA 14. Main results The overall quality of evidence was moderate to high, with reductions in confidence due to imprecision and heterogeneity for some outcomes. One hundred and two trials with 120 intervention arms (studies) were included, with 88 trials (involving over 28,000 women) providing data on smoking abstinence in late pregnancy. Interventions were categorised as counselling, health education, feedback, incentives, social support, exercise and dissemination. Authors' conclusions Psychosocial interventions to support women to stop smoking in pregnancy can increase the proportion of women who stop smoking in late pregnancy and the proportion of infants born low birthweight. Counselling, feedback and incentives appear to be effective, however the characteristics and context of the interventions should be carefully considered. The effect of health education and social support is less clear. New trials have been published during the preparation of this review and will be included in the next update."
Public Involvement in Global Genomics Research: A Scoping Review.	"Public involvement in research occurs when the public, patients, or research participants are actively contributing to the research process. Public involvement has been acknowledged as a key priority for prominent human genomics research initiatives in many different countries. However, to date, there has been no detailed analysis or review of the features, methods, and impacts of public involvement occurring in human genomics research projects worldwide. Here, we review the reported public involvement in 96 human genomics projects (initiatives), based on a database of initiatives hosted by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health, according to information reported on public domain websites. To conduct the scoping review, we applied a structured categorization of criteria to all information extracted from the search. We found that only a third of all initiatives reported public involvement in any capacity (32/96, 33%). In those reporting public involvement, we found considerable variation in both the methods and tasks of involvement. Some noteworthy initiatives reported diverse and comprehensive ways of involving the public, occurring through different stages of the research project cycle. Three notable initiatives reported a total of eight distinct impacts as a result of involving people. Our findings suggest there would be intrinsic value in having more public involvement occur in human genomics research worldwide. We also suggest that more systematic ways of reporting and evaluating involvement would be highly beneficial, to help develop best practices."
Public involvement in health and social sciences research: A concept analysis	"Background: Research funding bodies have significantly increased emphasis on the need for public involvement in research with the requirement to evidence effective methods and approaches to achieving this. Specific definitions and approaches within published research remain tokenistic and vague. Objective: The concept analysis explores and clarifies the nature and meaning of public involvement in health and social sciences research and identifies operational definitions which can be used to guide, develop and evaluate public involvement in research activity. Search strategy: A literature search was conducted using online databases. Systematic literature reviews and broader studies on the impact of PPI were included as was grey literature such as guidance from INVOLVE and research funding bodies. Limits were set to papers published in the last 10¬years and in the English language. A concept analysis framework adapted from Rodgers (Concept Development in Nursing: Foundations, Techniques and Applications. London, UK: Saunders; 2000) and Walker and Avant (Strategies for Theory construction in Nursing. Boston, MA: Pearson Prentice Hall; 2005) was applied. Main results: Five operational definitions were developed from the concept analysis: undefined involvement; targeted consultation; embedded consultation; co-production; and user-led research. Typical examples of each approach were identified from the literature. Defining attributes included having clear and agreed meaning and purpose for any involvement; reciprocal relationships; and value and recognition of the expertise of all those involved. Conclusions: The authors argue the need for researchers to more explicitly incorporate and evaluate details of approaches used. Impact of public involvement on a research study should be identified when reporting on findings to prevent tokenistic practices where involvement is viewed as secondary to the core research process."
Public involvement in health research systems: a governance framework.	"BACKGROUND: Growing interest in public involvement in health research has led to organisational and policy change. Additionally, an emerging body of policy-oriented scholarship has begun to identify the organisational and network arrangements that shape public involvement activity. Such developments suggest the need to clearly conceptualise and characterise public involvement in health research in terms of governance. METHODS: We drew on an established health research system framework to analyse governance functions related to public involvement, adapting scoping review methods to identify evidence from a corpus of journal papers and policy reports. We drew on the logics of aggregation and top down configuration, using a qualitative interpretive approach to combine and link findings from different studies into framework categories. RESULTS: We identified a total of 32 scholarly papers and 13 policy reports (n = 45 included papers) with relevance to governance for public involvement. Included papers were broadly consonant in identifying the need for activity to specify and support public involvement across all four governance functions of stewardship, financing, creating and sustaining resources, and research production and use. However, different visions for public involvement, and the activity required to implement it and achieve impact, were particularly evident with respect to the stewardship function, which seeks to set overall directions for research while addressing the potentially competing demands of a system's many constituents. CONCLUSIONS: A governance perspective has considerable value for public involvement in health research systems, supporting efforts to coordinate and institutionalise the burgeoning public involvement enterprise. Furthermore, it highlights challenges for what is, ultimately, a highly political intervention, suggesting that diverse publics must be both involved within health research systems and enrolled as governors of them."
Public involvement in the systematic review process in health and social care: a narrative review of case examples	"OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence on public involvement in the systematic review process in health and social care; to examine the different methods, levels and stages of involving the public; to synthesise the contributions of the public, as well as the identified tensions, facilitating strategies and recommendations for good practice. METHOD: Systematic literature search and narrative review. FINDINGS: Seven case examples were found covering the following review topics: patients' perspectives on electro-convulsive therapy; user involvement in nursing, midwifery and health visiting research; treatments for degenerative ataxias; teaching, learning and assessment of law in social work education; HIV health promotion for men who have sex with men; the conceptualisation, measurement, impact and outcomes of public involvement in health research; methods of consumer involvement in developing healthcare policy and research, clinical practice guidelines and patient information material. The public was found to contribute to systematic reviews by: refining the scope of the review; suggesting and locating relevant literature; appraising the literature; interpreting the review findings; writing up the review. Numerous tensions, facilitating strategies and recommendations were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The issues raised in this paper should assist researchers in developing and conducting systematic reviews with the involvement of the public. Copyright ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Public participation in health. A review of reviews.	"Background. This study aims to synthesize knowledge about the role of the public's participation in the definition, prioritization, rationalization, monitoring or control of policies, plans, governance, investment/disinvestment, and design of health services. Methods. Review of review articles (narrative or systematic) about consumer participation indexed in Pub- Med until August 2016. Results. Forty-two reviews were identified (eighteen systematic and twenty-four narrative). The extent of participation was provincial/regional or national. The issues addressed covered: What is public participation? What benefits are expected? Who participates in the representation of citizens? How and to what extent do citizens participate and with what outcomes? The impact of public participation has hardly been studied. Conclusions. There is moderate evidence in support of the argument that public participation legitimizes decisions of the Health Authorities, and improves outcomes of health policies. There is consensus on how participation techniques should be applied but there is a need to inquire more deeply into the level of impact of this participation."
Qualitative systematic review of barriers and facilitators to patient-involved antipsychotic prescribing.	"BACKGROUND: Despite policy and practice mandates for patient involvement, people with serious mental illness often feel marginalised in decisions about antipsychotic medication. Aims To examine stakeholder perspectives of barriers and facilitators to involving people with serious mental illness in antipsychotic prescribing decisions. METHOD: Systematic thematic synthesis. RESULTS: Synthesis of 29 studies identified the following key influences on involvement: patient's capability, desire and expectation for involvement, organisational context, and the consultation setting and processes. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal patient involvement in antipsychotic decisions demands that individual and contextual barriers are addressed. There was divergence in perceived barriers to involvement identified by patients and prescribers. For example, patients felt that lack of time in consultations was a barrier to involvement, something seldom raised by prescribers, who identified organisational barriers. Patients must understand their rights to involvement and the value of their expertise. Organisational initiatives should mandate prescriber responsibility to overcome barriers to involvement. Declaration of interest None."
Qualitative systematic review of barriers and facilitators to self-management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: views of patients and healthcare professionals	"Self-management interventions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can improve quality of life, reduce hospital admissions, and improve symptoms. However, many factors impede engagement for patients and practitioners. Qualitative research, with its focus on subjective experience, can provide invaluable insights into such factors. Therefore, a systematic review and synthesis of qualitative evidence on COPD self-management from the perspective of patients, carers, and practitioners was conducted. Following a systematic search and screening, 31 studies were appraised and data extracted for analysis. This review found that patients can adapt to COPD; however, learning to self-manage is often a protracted process. Emotional needs are considerable; frustration, depression, and anxiety are common. In addition, patients can face an assortment of losses and limitations on their lifestyle and social interaction. Over time, COPD can consume their existence, reducing motivation. Support from family can prove vital, yet tinged with ambivalence and burden. Practitioners may not have sufficient time, resources, or appropriate skills or confidence to provide effective self-management support, particularly in regard to patients' psychosocial needs. This can compound patients' capability to engage in self-management. For COPD self-management to be effective, patients' psychosocial needs must be prioritised alongside medication and exacerbation management. In addition, patients' personal beliefs regarding COPD and its management should be reviewed periodically to avoid problematic behaviours and enhance positive adaptions to the disease. Patients with COPD are not a homogenous group and no one intervention will prove effective for all. Finally, practitioners require greater education, training, and support to successfully assist patients."
Quality and acceptability of patient-reported outcome measures used in chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME): a systematic review	"PURPOSE: To review the quality and acceptability of condition-specific, domain-specific and generic multi-item patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) used in the assessment of adults with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). METHODS: Systematic literature searches were made to identify PROMs. Quality and acceptability was assessed against an appraisal framework, which captured evidence of both the thoroughness and results of evaluations: evidence of measurement (reliability, validity, responsiveness, interpretability, data quality/precision) and practical properties (feasibility, patient acceptability), and the extent of active patient involvement was sought. RESULTS: A total of 11 CFS/ME-specific, 55 domain-specific and 11 generic measures were reviewed. With the exception of the generic SF-36, all measures had mostly limited evidence of measurement and/or practical properties. Patient involvement was poorly reported and often cursory. CONCLUSIONS: The quality and acceptability of reviewed PROMs is limited, and recommendations for patient-reported assessment are difficult. Significant methodological and quality issues in PROM development/evaluation were identified by the appraisal framework, which must be addressed in future research. Clear discrepancies exist between what is measured in research and how patients define their experience of CFS/ME. Future PROM development/evaluation must seek to involve patients more collaboratively to measure outcomes of importance using relevant and credible methods of assessment."
Quality of guidelines on the management of diabetes in pregnancy: a systematic review.	"BACKGROUND: Diabetes during pregnancy can lead to severe risks for both mother and fetus when it is not managed properly. The use of rigorously developed guidelines with a robust implementation process can have a positive influence on the management of diabetes during pregnancy. This study aims to compare recommendations and assess the quality of clinical guidelines on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and pre-existing diabetes mellitus during pregnancy. METHODS: Guidelines were selected by searching PubMed, the Guideline Clearing House and Google. All guidelines developed since 2000 on diabetes during pregnancy in English or Dutch were considered. Recommendations of the guidelines were compared. Furthermore, the quality was assessed by two authors independently, using the AGREE instrument. RESULTS: Eight guidelines were included. According to the AGREE instrument, the quality of most guidelines was low. The domains editorial independence, stakeholder involvement and rigour of development had the lowest scores. Recommendations were mainly comparable on glycemic control, preconceptional counseling and prenatal care and labour. Differences between recommendations were found for screening on GDM and induction of labour. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of most guidelines concerning the management of diabetes during pregnancy needs to be improved. A more systematic approach in the development of these guidelines, more attention for updating procedures and piloting of the guidelines and involvement of target users and patients is recommended."
Quit and Win contests for smoking cessation.	"Background Quit and Win contests were developed in the 1980s by the Minnesota Heart Health Program, and have been widely used since then as a population-based smoking cessation intervention at local, national and international level. Since 1994 an international contest has been held every two years in as many as 80 countries (2002). Objectives To determine whether quit and win contests can deliver higher long-term quit rates than baseline community quit rates. To assess the impact of such programmes, we considered both the quit rates achieved by participants, and the population impact, which takes into account the proportion of the target population entering the contest. Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register, with additional searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Google Scholar. Search terms included competition*, quit and win, quit to win, contest*, prize*. Most recent search date was November 2007. Selection criteria We considered randomized controlled trials, allocating individuals or communities to experimental or control conditions. We also considered controlled studies with baseline and post-intervention measures. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted by one author and checked by the second. We contacted study authors for additional data where necessary. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking for at least six months from the start of the intervention. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available. We decided against performing a meta-analysis, because of the heterogeneity of the included studies, and the small number of scientifically valid studies. Main results Five studies met our inclusion criteria. Three demonstrated significantly higher quit rates (8% to 20%) for the quit and win group than for the control group at the 12-month assessment. However, the population impact measure, where available, suggests that the effect of contests on community prevalence of smoking is small, with fewer than one in 500 smokers quitting because of the contest. Levels of deception, where they could be quantified, were high. Although surveys suggest that international quit and win contests may be effective, especially in developing countries, the lack of controlled studies precludes any firm conclusions from this review. Authors' conclusions Quit and win contests at local and regional level appear to deliver quit rates above baseline community rates, although the population impact of the contests seems to be relatively low. Contests may be subject to levels of deception which could compromise the validity of the intervention. International contests may prove to be an effective mechanism, particularly in developing countries, but a lack of well-designed comparative studies precludes any firm conclusions."
Readability of Written Materials for CKD Patients: A Systematic Review	"BACKGROUND: The ""average"" patient has a literacy level of US grade 8 (age 13-14 years), but this may be lower for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Current guidelines suggest that patient education materials should be pitched at a literacy level of around 5th grade (age 10-11 years). This study aims to evaluate the readability of written materials targeted at patients with CKD. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. SETTING & POPULATION: Patient information materials aimed at adults with CKD and written in English. SEARCH STRATEGY & SOURCES: Patient education materials designed to be printed and read, sourced from practices in Australia and online at all known websites run by relevant international CKD organizations during March 2014. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Quantitative analysis of readability using Lexile Analyzer and Flesch-Kincaid tools. RESULTS: We analyzed 80 materials. Both Lexile Analyzer and Flesch-Kincaid analyses suggested that most materials required a minimum of grade 9 (age 14-15 years) schooling to read them. Only 5% of materials were pitched at the recommended level (grade 5). LIMITATIONS: Readability formulas have inherent limitations and do not account for visual information. We did not consider other media through which patients with CKD may access information. Although the study covered materials from the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, all non-Internet materials were sourced locally, and it is possible that some international paper-based materials were missed. Generalizability may be limited due to exclusion of non-English materials. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that patient information materials aimed at patients with CKD are pitched above the average patient's literacy level. This issue is compounded by cognitive decline in patients with CKD, who may have lower literacy than the average patient. It suggests that information providers need to consider their audience more carefully when preparing patient information materials, including user testing with a low-literacy patient population.

Reciprocity in therapeutic relationships: A conceptual review	"Reciprocity has generally been understood as a process of giving and taking, within an exchange of emotions or services, and has long been recognized as a central part of human life. However, an understanding of reciprocity in professional helping relationships has seldom received attention, despite movements in mental health care towards more collaborative approaches between service users and professionals. In this review, a systematic search of the published papers was conducted in order to explore how reciprocity is conceptualized and understood as part of the dyadic therapeutic relationship between professionals and service users. Eleven papers met our inclusion criteria and a narrative synthesis was used to synthesize the key concepts of reciprocity. The concepts of: 'dynamic equilibrium', 'shared affect', 'asymmetric alliance', and 'recognition as a fellow human being' were recurrent in understandings of reciprocity in professional contexts. These conceptualizations of reciprocity were also linked to specific behavioural and psychological processes. The findings suggest that reciprocity may be conceptualized and incorporated as a component of mental health care, with recurrent and observable processes which may be harnessed to promote positive outcomes for service users. To this end, we make recommendations for further research to progress and develop reciprocal processes in mental health care."
Recommendations for the Involvement of Patient Research Partners (PRP) in OMERACT Working Groups. A Report from the OMERACT 2014 Working Group on PRP	"OBJECTIVE: Patient participation in research is increasing; however, practical guidelines to enhance this participation are lacking. Specifically within the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) organization, although patients have participated in OMERACT meetings since 2002, consensus about the procedures for involving patients in working groups has not been formalized. The objective is to develop a set of recommendations regarding patient research partner (PRP) involvement in research working groups. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review on recommendations/guidelines of PRP involvement in research; elaborated a structured consensus process involving multiple participants to develop a set of recommendations; and sought endorsement of recommendations by OMERACT. RESULTS: In the 18 articles included in the literature review, there was general agreement on the broad concepts for recommendations covering PRP involvement in research although they were heterogeneous in detail. Most considered PRP involvement in all phases of research with early engagement, training, and support important, but details on the content were scarce. This review informed a larger consensus-building process regarding PRP inclusion in OMERACT research. Three overarching principles and 8 recommendations were developed, discussed, and refined at OMERACT 2014. The guiding principles were endorsed during the OMERACT plenary session. CONCLUSION: These recommendations for PRP involvement in OMERACT research reinforce the importance of patient participation throughout the research process as integral members. Although the applicability of the recommendations in other research contexts should be assessed, the generalizability is expected to be high. Future research should evaluate their implementation and their effect on outcome development."
Relationship between physical activity level and psychosocial and socioeconomic factors and issues in children and adolescents with asthma: a scoping review	"Background Asthma is a heterogeneous chronic airway disease whichmay reduce capability for physical activity. In healthy peers, physical activity is influenced by psychosocial and socioeconomic factors. Knowledge about the role of these factors has not been mapped in children and adolescents with asthma. Objective The main objective of this scoping review was to identify psychosocial and socioeconomic factors associated with physical activity level in children and adolescents with asthma in the literature. The specific objectives were to map the instruments used to measure these factors, report on the construction and validation of these instruments, map psychosocial and socioeconomic issues related to physical activity level reported in qualitative studies, and identify gaps in knowledge about the relationship between psychosocial and socioeconomic factors and physical activity level in children and adolescents with asthma. Inclusion criteria Types of participants Children and adolescents with asthma aged six to 18 years. Concept Psychosocial and socioeconomic factors related to physical activity level and participation. Context All physical activity contexts. Types of sources Quantitative and qualitative primary studies in English, with no date limit. Search strategy The databases searched included nine major databases for health and sports science, and five databases for unpublished studies. After screening and identification of studies, the reference lists of all identified reports were searched, and forward citation searches were conducted using four databases. Extraction of the results The following data were extracted: (a) relevant study characteristics and assessment of physical activity level, (b) instruments used to assess psychosocial and socioeconomic factors, (c) association between physical activity level and these factors, (d) construction and validation of instruments, and (e) psychosocial and socioeconomic issues related to physical activity participation. Presentation of the results Twenty-one quantitative and 13 qualitative studies were included. In cross-sectional studies, enjoyment, physical self-concept, self-efficacy, attitudes and beliefs about physical activity and health, psychological distress, health- related quality of life, and social support were more often reported as being correlated with physical activity level. In three studies, the construct validity was assessed by factor analysis and construct reliability tests for the study population. Qualitative studies reported 10 issues related to physical activity participation, and capability and being like peers were most commonly reported. There was no direct evidence that qualitative research informed the development or adjustment of instruments in quantitative studies. Conclusions Seven psychosocial factors correlated with physical activity level; capability and being like peers were the most commonly reported issues. Reports of the construction and validation of instruments were sparse."
Remote and web 2.0 interventions for promoting physical activity.	"Background Remote and web 2.0 interventions for promoting physical activity (PA) are becoming increasingly popular but their ability to achieve long term changes are unknown. Objectives To compare the effectiveness of remote and web 2.0 interventions for PA promotion in community dwelling adults (aged 16 years and above) with a control group exposed to placebo or no or minimal intervention. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and some other databases (from earliest dates available to October 2012). Reference lists of relevant articles were checked. No language restrictions were applied. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared remote and web 2.0 PA interventions for community dwelling adults with a placebo or no or minimal intervention control group. We included studies if the principal component of the intervention was delivered using remote or web 2.0 technologies (for example the internet, smart phones) or more traditional methods (for example telephone, mail-outs), or both. To assess behavioural change over time, the included studies had a minimum of 12 months follow-up from the start of the intervention to the final results. We excluded studies that had more than a 20% loss to follow-up if they did not apply an intention-to-treat analysis. Data collection and analysis At least two authors independently assessed the quality of each study and extracted the data. Non-English language papers were reviewed with the assistance of an interpreter who was an epidemiologist. Study authors were contacted for additional information where necessary. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the continuous measures of self-reported PA and cardio-respiratory fitness. For studies with dichotomous outcomes, odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated. Main results A total of 11 studies recruiting 5862 apparently healthy adults met the inclusion criteria. All of the studies took place in high-income countries. The effect of the interventions on cardiovascular fitness at one year (two studies; 444 participants) was positive and moderate with significant heterogeneity of the observed effects (SMD 0.40; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.76; high quality evidence). The effect of the interventions on self-reported PA at one year (nine studies; 4547 participants) was positive and moderate (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.28; moderate quality evidence) with heterogeneity (I(superscript 2) = 37%) in the observed effects. One study reported positive results at two years (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.32; moderate quality evidence). When studies were stratified by risk of bias, the studies at low risk of bias (eight studies; 3403 participants) had an increased effect (SMD 0.28; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.40; moderate quality evidence). The most effective interventions applied a tailored approach to the type of PA and used telephone contact to provide feedback and to support changes in PA levels. There was no evidence of an increased risk of adverse events (seven studies; 2892 participants). Risk of bias was assessed as low (eight studies; 3060 participants) or moderate (three studies; 2677 participants). There were no differences in effectiveness between studies using different types of professionals delivering the intervention (for example health professional, exercise specialist). There was no difference in pooled estimates between studies that generated the prescribed PA using an automated computer programme versus a human, nor between studies that used pedometers as part of their intervention compared to studies that did not. Authors' conclusions We found consistent evidence to support the effectiveness of remote and web 2.0 interventions for promoting PA. These interventions have positive, moderate sized effects on increasing self-reported PA and measured cardio-respiratory fitness, at least at 12 months. The effectiveness of these interventions was supported by moderate and high quality studies. However, there continues to be a paucity of cost effectiveness data and studies that include participants from varying socioeconomic or ethnic groups. To better understand the independent effect of individual programme components, longer term studies, with at least one year follow-up, are required."
Reporting of exercise attendance rates for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review	"While recommendations for the duration, frequency, mode and intensity of exercise programmes for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are specified in consensus statements, criteria for exercise session attendance are less clear. The review questions were: (i) how commonly are a priori criteria and attendance rates reported for people with COPD participating in exercise programmes and (ii) what is the strength of association between attendance and improvements in functional exercise capacity. Database searches identified primary studies of people with COPD participating in exercise or pulmonary rehabilitation programmes of at least 2 weeks duration. Primary outcomes were a priori criteria for attendance, reports of attendance at supervised exercise sessions and mean improvements in functional exercise assessments. Data extraction processes were confirmed prospectively (>80% agreement). Variants of exercise attendance data were described. Linear associations between attendance and improvements in exercise outcomes were explored (Pearson r, P < 0.05). Of the 234 included studies, 86 (37%) reported attendance and 29 (12%) provided a priori criteria for attendance. In the small sample of studies which reported attendance and functional exercise data before and after the intervention, there was little to no relationship between improvements in functional exercise capacity and training volume (prescribed r = -0.03, P = 0.88; attended r = -0.24, P = 0.18). Reporting of exercise programme attendance rates is low and of variable quality for people with COPD. Consistent and explicit reporting of exercise attendance in people with COPD will enable calculation of dose-response relationships and determine the value of a priori exercise attendance criteria.

Representation of people with intellectual disabilities in randomised controlled trials on antipsychotic treatment for behavioural problems	"Behavioural problems are common in people with intellectual disability (ID) and are often treated with antipsychotics. To establish the frequency and characteristics of people with ID included in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on antipsychotic treatment for behavioural problems, and to investigate the quality of these RCTs. A literature search in EMBASE, PubMed and Cochrane was performed and reviewed. People with ID participated in 27 of the 100 included RCTs. The RCTs were of good quality but smaller compared with trials in patients with dementia or schizophrenia (average sample sizes = 55, 124 and 374). In 13/27 trials no clear definition of ID was given. Over 25 different outcome measures were used to assess behavioural problems. Studies in which people with ID are included are of a sufficient quality, but of a small size. The heterogeneity in the characteristics of the ID population included as well as in the applied assessment instruments makes performing meta-analyses unfeasible."
Research priority setting in childhood chronic disease: a systematic review.	"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate research priority setting approaches in childhood chronic diseases and to describe the priorities of stakeholders including patients, caregivers/families and health professionals. DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL from inception to 16 October 2016. Studies that elicited stakeholder priorities for paediatric chronic disease research were eligible for inclusion. Data on the prioritisation process were extracted using an appraisal checklist. Generated priorities were collated into common topic areas. RESULTS: We identified 83 studies (n=15 722). Twenty (24%) studies involved parents/caregivers and four (5%) children. The top three health areas were cancer (11%), neurology (8%) and endocrine/metabolism (8%). Priority topic areas were treatment (78%), disease trajectory (48%), quality of life/psychosocial impact (48%), disease onset/prevention (43%), knowledge/self-management (33%), prevalence (30%), diagnostic methods (28%), access to healthcare (25%) and transition to adulthood (12%). The methods included workshops, Delphi techniques, surveys and focus groups/interviews. Specific methods for collecting and prioritising research topics were described in only 60% of studies. Most reviewed studies were conducted in high-income nations. CONCLUSIONS: Research priority setting activities in paediatric chronic disease cover many discipline areas and have elicited a broad range of topics. However, child/caregiver involvement is uncommon, and the methods often lack clarity. A systematic and explicit process that involves patients and families in partnership may help to inform a more patient and family-relevant research agenda in paediatric chronic disease.

Resident participation in neighbourhood audit tools - a scoping review	"Background: Healthy urban environments require careful planning and a testing of environmental quality that goes beyond statutory requirements. Moreover, it requires the inclusion of resident views, perceptions and experiences that help deepen the understanding of local (public health) problems. To facilitate this, neighbourhoods should be mapped in a way that is relevant to them. One way to do this is participative neighbourhood auditing. This paper provides an insight into availability and characteristics of participatory neighbourhood audit instruments. Methods: A scoping review in scientific and grey literature, consisting of the following steps: literature search, identification and selection of relevant audit instruments, data extraction and data charting (including a work meeting to discuss outputs), reporting. Results: In total, 13 participatory instruments were identified. The role of residents in most instruments was as 'data collectors'; only few instruments included residents in other audit activities like problem definition or analysis of data. The instruments identified focus mainly on physical, not social, neighbourhood characteristics. Paper forms containing closed-ended questions or scales were the most often applied registration method. Conclusions: The results show that neighbourhood auditing could be improved by including social aspects in the audit tools. They also show that the role of residents in neighbourhood auditing is limited; however, little is known about how their engagement takes place in practice. Developers of new instruments need to balance not only social and physical aspects, but also resident engagement and scientific robustness. Technologies like mobile applications pose new opportunities for participative approaches in neighbourhood auditing. Copyright ¬© The Author 2017.

"Review 1: community engagement for health via coalitions, collaborations and partnerships: a systematic review"	"This paper presents the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 studies that examined the effectiveness of community engagement approaches at improving health and wellbeing and reducing inequalities among disadvantaged groups. Overall results indicate that community engagement utilizing coalitions, collaborations or partnerships encompasses a wide range of health topics and populations, most commonly healthy eating, physical activity and low-income populations. In addition, higher levels of community engagement are linked to greater beneficial effects than lower community engagement for interventions that target health outcomes among disadvantaged groups."
"Review 2: community engagement for health via coalitions, collaborations and partnerships: a systematic review and meta-analysis"	"This paper presents the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis of 64 studies that explored the efficacy of community engagement approaches at improving health and wellbeing, as well as in reducing health inequalities. Overall findings suggest that community-led or community collaboration projects which design, deliver and evaluate health interventions are associated with larger behavioural outcomes. Also, when coalitions, collaborations and partnerships with community members include the use of bidirectional communications, collective decision making and community member or professional training support for intervention provision, a higher extent of community engagement across the project's design, delivery and evaluation is also found."
"Review 3: community engagement for health via coalitions, collaborations and partnerships (on-line social media and social networks): a systematic review and meta-analysis"	"This paper presents the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 studies that evaluated the effectiveness of online social media/social networks on the extent of community engagement in interventions that aim to improve health and wellbeing, and reduce health inequalities. Overall results suggest that community engagement is not utilized across the design and evaluation of health interventions, and that the type of community engagement undertaken with intervention delivery focuses on peer interactions alone."
Scandinavian women's experiences with abortions on request: a systematic review.	"REVIEW QUESTION/OBJECTIVE: The objective of the review was to explore the experiences of Scandinavian women with abortions on request, that is, before, during and after the intervention. INTRODUCTION: In Scandinavia, the primary issues surrounding the abortion debate to date have been women's legal rights to an abortion, and, to a lesser extent, how women experience an abortion on request and how society could and should support them. This systematic review investigated Scandinavian women's experiences in relation to this intervention. INCLUSION CRITERIA: The current review included all studies that focused on adult women (aged 15 and over) living in Scandinavia (Denmark, Sweden and Norway) who have experienced an abortion on request (a medically or surgically induced abortion without a medical indication for the mother or child, described here as an ""abortion on request""). The phenomena of interest were Scandinavian women's experiences in relation to an abortion on request, that is, before, during and after the intervention, and self-reported psychosocial or psychological health consequences following the abortion. This systematic review focused on Scandinavian hospital or clinical environments where authorized medical personnel performed abortions on request. This review considered studies that focused on qualitative data including, but not limited to, designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research and feminist research. METHODS: A three-step search strategy was used to identify published and unpublished studies from 1973 to June 2016. The comprehensive literature search identified nine studies that met the inclusion criteria. These nine studies were assessed by two independent reviewers using the standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Six of these studies were deemed to be of sufficient methodological quality for inclusion in this systematic review. Data were extracted from the six included studies using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI. A total of 24 qualitative research findings were pooled using JBI methodology. RESULTS: A total of six studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 80 participants. Twenty-four research findings were extracted and grouped into six categories that were synthesized into three synthesized findings: 1) Experiences in connection with the decision-making process; 2) Experiences in connection with the procedure; and 3) Experiences after abortion. The vast majority of participants were aged 15 to 24 years at the time of the abortion. Conclusions and recommendations for practice apply to Scandinavian women within this age group. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review indicates that young Scandinavians consider it a woman's responsibility to obtain and use contraceptives and that young women seeking an abortion on request have little knowledge of their own bodies with respect to fertility and their menstrual cycles. Young Scandinavian women between the ages of 15 and 24 years seeking an abortion on request experience conflicted feelings. They feel both joy and shame about their pregnancies and, during the decision-making process, are torn between the possibility of motherhood and the reasonable and expected choice of abortion that is supported by their parents and friends. The majority of women experience worse-than-expected pain and discomfort in connection with the abortion procedure. The approach of healthcare staff to women's physical needs is described as good and professional, but there is little or no focus on the women's emotional and existential needs. After abortions on request, young women express ambivalence: relief that the pregnancy has been terminated, coupled with a feeling of loss. Some suffer from guilt and some express regret."
School Health Program: Impacting Physical Activity Behaviors Among Disadvantaged Students	"BACKGROUND Children from disadvantaged backgrounds are more apt to experience lower availability of nutritious foods, lack opportunities to exercise, and lack access to recreational facilities, and thus, are more likely to be obese and at greater risk for developing chronic diseases. We review school health education programs' impact on physical activity behaviors among disadvantaged students. METHODS: The inclusion criteria of the study were articles: published in English with full text between 2011 and 2017; focused on school health education programs for disadvantaged school-aged students; assessed programs including a physical activity component; examined school-aged children and adolescents' physical activity behaviors; and assessed programs with comparison groups. RESULTS: There were 13 studies matching inclusion criteria in this review. The results of this review indicated that school-based health education programs which included culturally appropriate physical activity, parent involvement, and enhanced student motivation and choice of activities appeared to increase physical activity levels among disadvantaged school-aged students. Health education programs should also emphasize behavioral change skills, such as goal setting and self-motivation, to positively impact on students' physical activity behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: School-based health education programs may help increase access to physical activity among disadvantaged populations."
School-based programmes for preventing smoking.	"Background Helping young people to avoid starting smoking is a widely endorsed public health goal, and schools provide a route to communicate with nearly all young people. School-based interventions have been delivered for close to 40 years. Objectives The primary aim of this review was to determine whether school smoking interventions prevent youth from starting smoking. Our secondary objective was to determine which interventions were most effective. This included evaluating the effects of theoretical approaches; additional booster sessions; programme deliverers; gender effects; and multifocal interventions versus those focused solely on smoking. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsyclNFO, ERIC, CINAHL, Health Star, and Dissertation Abstracts for terms relating to school-based smoking cessation programmes. In addition, we screened the bibliographies of articles and ran individual MEDLINE searches for 133 authors who had undertaken randomised controlled trials in this area. The most recent searches were conducted in October 2012. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where students, classes, schools, or school districts were randomised to intervention arm(s) versus a control group, and followed for at least six months. Participants had to be youth (aged 5 to 18). Interventions could be any curricula used in a school setting to deter tobacco use, and outcome measures could be never smoking, frequency of smoking, number of cigarettes smoked, or smoking indices. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Based on the type of outcome, we placed studies into three groups for analysis: Pure Prevention cohorts (Group 1), Change in Smoking Behaviour over time (Group 2) and Point Prevalence of Smoking (Group 3). Main results One hundred and thirty-four studies involving 428,293 participants met the inclusion criteria. Some studies provided data for more than one group. Authors' conclusions Pure Prevention cohorts showed a significant effect at longest follow-up, with an average 12% reduction in starting smoking compared to the control groups. However, no overall effect was detected at one year or less. The combined social competence and social influences interventions showed a significant effect at one year and at longest follow-up. Studies that deployed a social influences programme showed no overall effect at any time point; multimodal interventions and those with an information-only approach were similarly ineffective."
Self-care for people coping with long-term health conditions in the community	"Purpose Äì Long-term health problems put great pressures on health and social care services. Supporting Äúself-careÄù has measurable benefits in helping patients cope better, but is difficult to do in practice. The purpose of this paper is to help improve services by exploring existing evidence about the views of patients and general practitioners. Design/methodology/approach Äì The search terms were identified following detailed discussion with service users. Five databases (PUBMED, CINAHL, TRIP, SCIE and PSYCINFO) were interrogated against pre-set questions and criteria. The data were managed in EndNote v6 and analysed in a series of Word tables. Findings Äì In total, 37 community-based studies were identified, covering diverse chronic illnesses. Analysis of Äúbarriers and enablersÄù showed a very complex picture, with health systems often actively inhibiting the responsiveness and flexibility which support self-care. Directly seeking service user and practitioner views could shape more effective services. Research limitations/implications Äì Further research is needed into: the purpose and outcomes of user involvement, the relationship between integrated care and self-care, how patient motivation and resilience can be encouraged in primary care and the effect of current incentive schemes on self-care support. Due to organisational changes, eligible studies were reviewed by one researcher only and these were mainly qualitative studies lacking generalisability. However, the results spanned a range of settings and health conditions. They are also clearly supported by later primary research findings. Practical implications Äì Several evidence-based, achievable opportunities to improve self-care support in primary care settings are identified. Originality/value Äì This user-driven study offers detailed analysis of what helps or hinders self-care in everyday life."
Shared Decision Making in Pediatrics: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis	"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of interventions to support shared decision making (SDM) with pediatric patients. OBJECTIVES: To summarize the efficacy of SDM interventions in pediatrics on patient-centered outcomes. DATA SOURCES: We searched Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and Ovid PsycInfo from database inception to December 30, 2013, and performed an environmental scan. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included interventions designed to engage pediatric patients, parents, or both in a medical decision, regardless of study design or reported outcomes. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: We reviewed all studies in duplicate for inclusion, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. Meta-analysis was performed on 3 outcomes: knowledge, decisional conflict, and satisfaction. RESULTS: Sixty-one citations describing 54 interventions met eligibility criteria. Fifteen studies reported outcomes such that they were eligible for inclusion in meta-analysis. Heterogeneity across studies was high. Meta-analysis revealed SDM interventions significantly improved knowledge (standardized mean difference SMD] 1.21, 95% confidence interval CI] 0.26 to 2.17, P = .01) and reduced decisional conflict (SMD -1.20, 95% CI -2.01 to -0.40, P = .003). Interventions showed a nonsignificant trend toward increased satisfaction (SMD 0.37, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.78, P = .08). LIMITATIONS: Included studies were heterogeneous in nature, including their conceptions of SDM. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: A limited evidence base suggests that pediatric SDM interventions improve knowledge and decisional conflict, but their impact on other outcomes is unclear.

Smartphone and tablet self management apps for asthma.	"Background Asthma is one of the most common long-term conditions worldwide, which places considerable pressure on patients, communities and health systems. The major international clinical guidelines now recommend the inclusion of self management programmes in the routine management of patients with asthma. These programmes have been associated with improved outcomes in patients with asthma. However, the implementation of self management programmes in clinical practice, and their uptake by patients, is still poor. Recent developments in mobile technology, such as smartphone and tablet computer apps, could help develop a platform for the delivery of self management interventions that are highly customisable, low-cost and easily accessible. Objectives To assess the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of using smartphone and tablet apps to facilitate the self management of individuals with asthma. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register (CAGR), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Health Library, Compendex/Inspec/Referex, IEEEXplore, ACM Digital Library, CiteSeer(superscript x) and CAB abstracts via Web of Knowledge. We also searched registers of current and ongoing trials and the grey literature. We checked the reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for additional references. We searched for studies published from 2000 onwards. The latest search was run in June 2013. Selection criteria We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared self management interventions for patients with clinician-diagnosed asthma delivered via smartphone apps to self management interventions delivered via traditional methods (e.g. paper-based asthma diaries). Data collection and analysis We used standard methods expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. Our primary outcomes were symptom scores; frequency of healthcare visits due to asthma exacerbations or complications and health-related quality of life. Main results We included two RCTs with a total of 408 participants. We found no cluster RCTs, controlled before and after studies or interrupted time series studies that met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Both RCTs evaluated the effect of a mobile phone-based asthma self management intervention on asthma control by comparing it to traditional, paper-based asthma self management. One study allowed participants to keep daily entries of their asthma symptoms, asthma medication usage, peak flow readings and peak flow variability on their mobile phone, from which their level of asthma control was calculated remotely and displayed together with the corresponding asthma self management recommendations. In the other study, participants recorded the same readings twice daily, and they received immediate self management feedback in the form of a three-colour traffic light display on their phones. Participants falling into the amber zone of their action plan twice, or into the red zone once, received a phone call from an asthma nurse who enquired about the reasons for their uncontrolled asthma. Authors' conclusions The current evidence base is not sufficient to advise clinical practitioners, policy-makers and the general public with regards to the use of smartphone and tablet computer apps for the delivery of asthma self management programmes. In order to understand the efficacy of apps as standalone interventions, future research should attempt to minimise the differential clinical management of patients between control and intervention groups. Those studies evaluating apps as part of complex, multicomponent interventions, should attempt to tease out the relative contribution of each intervention component. Consideration of the theoretical constructs used to inform the development of the intervention would help to achieve this goal. Finally, researchers should also take into account: the role of ancillary components in moderating the observed effects, the seasonal nature of asthma and long-term adherence to self management practices."
Stakeholder engagement to inform HIV clinical trials: a systematic review of the evidence	"INTRODUCTION: Stakeholder engagement is an essential component of HIV clinical trials. We define stakeholder engagement as an input by individuals or groups with an interest in HIV clinical trials to inform the design or conduct of said trials. Despite its value, stakeholder engagement to inform HIV clinical trials has not been rigorously examined. The purpose of our systematic review is to examine stakeholder engagement for HIV clinical trials and compare it to the recommendations of the UNAIDS/AVAC Good Participatory Practice (GPP) guidelines. METHODS: We used the PRISMA checklist and identified English language studies describing stakeholder engagement to inform HIV clinical trials. Four databases (PubMed, Ovid, CINAHL and Web of Science) and six journals were searched, with additional studies identified using handsearching and expert input. Two independent reviewers examined citations, abstracts and full texts. Data were extracted on country, engagement methods, stakeholder types and purpose of stakeholder engagement. Based on the GPP guidelines, we examined how frequently stakeholder engagement was conducted to inform clinical trial research question development, protocol development, recruitment, enrolment, follow-up, results and dissemination. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Of the 917 citations identified, 108 studies were included in the analysis. Forty-eight studies (44.4%) described stakeholder engagement in high-income countries, thirty (27.8%) in middle-income countries and nine (8.3%) in low-income countries. Fourteen methods for stakeholder engagement were identified, including individual (e.g. interviews) and group (e.g. community advisory boards) strategies. Thirty-five types of stakeholders were engaged, with approximately half of the studies (60; 55.6%) engaging HIV-affected community stakeholders (e.g. people living with HIV, at-risk or related populations of interest). We observed greater frequency of stakeholder engagement to inform protocol development (49 studies; 45.4%) and trial recruitment (47 studies; 43.5%). Fewer studies described stakeholder engagement to inform post-trial processes related to trial results (3; 2.8%) and dissemination (11; 10.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify important directions for future stakeholder engagement research and suggestions for policy. Most notably, we found that stakeholder engagement was more frequently conducted to inform early stages of HIV clinical trials compared to later stages. In order to meet recommendations established in the GPP guidelines, greater stakeholder engagement across all clinical trial stages is needed. Copyright ¬© 2018 The Authors.

Stakeholders' perspectives on biobank-based genomic research: systematic review of the literature	"The success of biobank-based genomic research is widely dependent on people's willingness to donate their tissue. Thus, stakeholders' opinions should be considered in the development of best practice guidelines for research and recruiting participants. We systematically analyzed the empirical literature describing different stakeholders' views towards ethical questions with regard to type of consent, data sharing and return of incidental findings. Patients are more open to one-time general consent than the public. Only a small proportion desires recontact if the research aim changed. A broad consent model would prevent only a small proportion of patients from participating in research. Although professionals are concerned about a risk of reidentification, patients and the public support data sharing and find that the benefit of research outweighs the potential risk of reidentification. However, they desire detailed information about the privacy protection measures. Regarding the return of incidental findings, the public and professionals focus on clinically actionable results, whereas patients are interested in receiving as much information as possible. For professionals, concrete guidelines that help managing the return of incidental findings should be warranted. For this it would be helpful addressing the different categories - actionable, untreatable and inheritable diseases - upfront with patients and public."
"Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption, correlates and interventions among Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities: a scoping review."	"OBJECTIVES: Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption in Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is reported to be disproportionally high compared with the general Australian population. This review aimed to scope the literature documenting SSB consumption and interventions to reduce SSB consumption among Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Findings will inform strategies to address SSB consumption in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. METHODS: PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, Informit, Joanna Briggs Institute EBP, Mura databases and grey literature were searched for articles published between January 1980 and June 2018. Studies were included if providing data specific to an Australian Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander population's SSB consumption or an intervention that focused on reducing SSB consumption in this population. DESIGN: Systematic scoping review. RESULTS: 59 articles were included (1846 screened). While reported SSB consumption was high, there were age-related and community-related differences observed in some studies. Most studies were conducted in remote or rural settings. Implementation of nutrition interventions that included an SSB component has built progressively in remote communities since the 1980s with a growing focus on community-driven, culturally sensitive approaches. More recent studies have focused exclusively on SSB consumption. Key SSB-related intervention elements included incentivising healthier options; reducing availability of less-healthy options; nutrition education; multifaceted or policy implementation (store nutrition or government policy). CONCLUSIONS: There was a relatively large number of studies reporting data on SSB consumption and/or sales, predominantly from remote and rural settings. During analysis it was subjectively clear that the more impactful studies were those which were community driven or involved extensive community consultation and collaboration. Extracting additional SSB-specific consumption data from an existing nationally representative survey of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people could provide detailed information for demographic subgroups and benchmarks for future interventions. It is recommended that a consistent, culturally appropriate, set of consumption measures be developed. Copyright ¬© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

Supervised dosing with a long-acting opioid medication in the management of opioid dependence	"BACKGROUND: Opioid dependence (OD) is an increasing clinical and public health problem worldwide. International guidelines recommend opioid substitution treatment (OST), such as methadone and buprenorphine, as first-line medication treatment for OD. A negative aspect of OST is that the medication used can be diverted both through sale on the black market, and the unsanctioned use of medications. Daily supervised administration of medications used in OST has the advantage of reducing the risk of diversion, and may promote therapeutic engagement, potentially enhancing the psychosocial aspect of OST, but costs more and is more restrictive on the client than dispensing for off-site consumption. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review is to compare the effectiveness of OST with supervised dosing relative to dispensing of medication for off-site consumption. SEARCH METHODS: We searched in Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science from inception up to April 2016. Ongoing and unpublished studies were searched via ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/).All searches included non-English language literature. We handsearched references on topic-related systematic reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), and prospective controlled cohort studies, involving people who are receiving OST (methadone, buprenorphine) and comparing supervised dosing with dispensing of medication to be consumed away from the dispensing point, usually without supervision. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: Six studies (four RCTs and two prospective observational cohort studies), involving 7999 participants comparing supervised OST treatment with unsupervised treatment, met the inclusion criteria. The risk of bias was generally moderate across trials, but the results reported on outcomes that we planned to consider were limited. Overall, we judged the quality of the evidence from very low to low for all the outcomes.We found no difference in retention at any duration with supervised compared to unsupervised dosing (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12, 716 participants, four trials, low-quality evidence) or in retention in the shortest follow-up period, three months (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.05; 472 participants, three trials, low-quality evidence). Additional data at 12 months from one observational study found no difference in retention between groups (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.14; n = 300).There was no difference in abstinence at the end of treatment (self-reported drug use) (67% versus 60%, P = 0.33, 293 participants, one trial, very low-quality evidence); and in diversion of medication (5% versus 2%, 293 participants, one trial, very low-quality evidence).Regarding our secondary outcomes, we did not found a difference in the incidence of adverse effects in the supervised compared to unsupervised control group (RR 0.63; 96% CI 0.10 to 3.86; 363 participants, two trials, very low-quality evidence). Data on severity of dependence were very limited (244 participants, one trial) and showed no difference between the two approaches. Data on deaths were reported in two studies. One trial reported two deaths in the supervised group (low-quality evidence), while in the cohort study all-cause mortality was found lower in regular supervision group (crude mortality rate 0.60 versus 0.81 per 100 person-years), although after adjustment insufficient evidence existed to suggest that regular supervision was protective (mortality rate ratio = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.67 to 2.27).No studies reported pain symptoms, drug craving, aberrant opioid-related behaviours, days of unsanctioned opioid use and overdose. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Take-home medication strategies are attractive to treatment services due to lower costs, and place less restrictions on clients, but it is unknown whether they may be associated with increased risk of diversion and unsanctioned use of medication. There is uncertainty about the effects of supervised dosing compared with unsupervised medication due to the low and very low quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of interest for this review. Data on defined secondary outcomes were similarly limited. More research comparing supervised and take-home medication strategies is needed to support decisions on the relative effectiveness of these strategies. The trials should be designed and conducted with high quality and over a longer follow-up period to support comparison of strategies at different stages of treatment. In particular, there is a need for studies assessing in more detail the risk of diversion and safety outcomes of using supervised OST to manage opioid dependence."
Sustainability of community-based fall prevention programs: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Fall prevention programs may be implemented but not sustained. We conducted a systematic review to identify any theories, models, frameworks, influencing factors or interventions for sustaining fall prevention programs in the community. METHODS: Peer-reviewed publications describing, investigating, or evaluating program sustainability were accessed. A narrative review was conducted to compare and synthesize study findings. RESULTS: Nineteen publications were included. Three conceptual frameworks were identified describing how programs may be better sustained. While ongoing financial support and the participation of older people were commonly reported influences, other factors specific to the type of program and setting were also reported. Planning, training, and collaboration between program stakeholders may facilitate sustainable programs. IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: Organizations can use these findings when planning for sustainable programs. However more robust empirical studies are needed to confirm the value of conceptual frameworks, the critical factors and most effective interventions for sustaining community-based fall prevention programs.

Synthesising conceptual frameworks for patient and public involvement in research - a critical appraisal of a meta-narrative review.	"CONCLUSIONS: Although the aims of the authors' synthesis were commendable, and the conceptual framework presented was coherent and attractive, the paper did not demonstrate a transparent and replicable meta-narrative review approach. There is a continuing need for a more rigorous synthesis of conceptual frameworks for PPI. BACKGROUND: A number of conceptual frameworks for patient and public involvement (PPI) in research have been published in recent years. Although some are based on empirical research and/or existing theory, in many cases the basis of the conceptual frameworks is not evident. In 2015 a systematic review was published by a collaborative review group reporting a meta-narrative approach to synthesise a conceptual framework for PPI in research (hereafter 'the synthesis'). As the first such synthesis it is important to critically scrutinise this meta-narrative review. The 'RAMESES publication standards for meta-narrative reviews' provide a framework for critically appraising published meta-narrative reviews such as this synthesis, although we recognise that these were published concurrently. Thus the primary objective of this research was to appraise this synthesis of conceptual frameworks for PPI in research in order to inform future conceptualisation. METHODS: Four researchers critically appraised the synthesis using the RAMESES publication standards as a framework for assessment. Data were extracted independently using a data extraction form closely based on the RAMESES publication standards. Each item from the standards was assessed on a four point scale (0=unmet, 1=minimally met, 2=partly met, 3=fully met). The four critical appraisals were then compared and any differences resolved through discussion. RESULTS: A good degree of inter-rater reliability was found. A consensus assessment of the synthesis as a meta-narrative review of PPI conceptual frameworks was achieved with an average of '1' (minimally met) across all 20 items. Two key items ('evidence of adherence to guiding principles of meta-narrative review' and 'analysis and synthesis processes') were both wholly unmet. Therefore the paper did not meet our minimum requirements for a meta-narrative review. We found the RAMESES publication standards were a useful tool for carrying out a critical appraisal although some minor improvements are suggested."
Systematic Review of Quantitative Measures of Stakeholder Engagement.	We present the results of a systematic review of the existing quantitative measures of stakeholder engagement in published research and programs. We used the methods of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta?Analyses (PRISMA16) to review the literature on measures of stakeholder engagement.
Systematic review of social media interventions for smoking cessation	"BACKGROUND: Popular social media could extend the reach of smoking cessation efforts. In this systematic review, our objectives were: 1) to determine whether social media interventions for smoking cessation are feasible, acceptable, and potentially effective; 2) to identify approaches for recruiting subjects; and 3) to examine the specific intervention design components and strategies employed to promote user engagement and retention. METHODS: We searched Scopus, Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science through July 2016 and reference lists of relevant articles. Included studies described social media interventions for smoking cessation and must have reported outcomes related to feasibility, acceptability, usability, or smoking-related outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 7 studies (all were published since 2014) that enrolled 9755 participants (median=136 range 40 to 9042]). Studies mainly used Facebook (n=4) or Twitter (n=2), and emerged as feasible and acceptable. Five studies reported smoking-related outcomes such as greater abstinence, reduction in relapse, and an increase in quit attempts. Most studies (n=6) recruited participants using online or Facebook advertisements. Tailored content, targeted reminders, and moderated discussions were used to promote participant engagement. Three studies found that active participation through posting comments or liking content may be associated with improved outcomes. Retention ranged from 35% to 84% (median=70%) across the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our review highlights the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of social media interventions for smoking cessation. Future research should continue to explore approaches for promoting user engagement and retention, and whether sustained engagement translates to clinically meaningful smoking cessation outcomes.

Systematic review of the impact of worksite wellness programs	"OBJECTIVES: To analyze the impact of worksite wellness programs on health and financial outcomes, and the effect of incentives on participation. METHODS: Sources were PubMed, CINAHL and EconLit, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane for 2000-2011. We examined articles with comparison groups that assessed health-related behaviors, physiologic markers, healthcare cost, and absenteeism. Data on intervention, outcome, size, industry, research design, and incentive use were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 33 studies evaluated 63 outcomes. Positive effects were found for threefourths of observational designs compared with half of outcomes in randomized controlled trials. A total of 8 of 13 studies found improvements in physical activity, 6 of 12 in diet, 6 of 12 in body mass index/weight, and 3 of 4 in mental health. A total of 6 of 7 studies on tobacco and 2 of 3 on alcohol use found significant reductions. All 4 studies on absenteeism and 7 of 8 on healthcare costs estimated significant decreases. Only 2 of 23 studies evaluated the impact of incentives and found positive health outcomes and decreased costs. CONCLUSIONS: The studies yielded mixed results regarding impact of wellness programs on healthrelated behaviors, substance use, physiologic markers, and cost, while the evidence for effects on absenteeism and mental health is insufficient. The validity of those findings is reduced by the lack of rigorous evaluation designs. Further, the body of publications is in stark contrast to the widespread use of such programs, and research on the effect of incentives is lacking."
Teachers and pre-service teachers as partners in collaborative teacher research: A systematic literature review	"A systematic literature review (N = 14) was performed with a focus on the influence of collaborative teacher research on the professional development of pre-service teachers (PTs). A thematic overview of reported outcomes is presented. Collaborative teacher research has proven itself to be a promising practice for improving PTs' knowledge and attitudes regarding collaboration, reflection, inquiry, and student-centred teaching. Shared inquiry in less hierarchical partnerships between pre-service and in-service teachers, and other multiple actors, advances PT's learning more than one-to-one relationships between a mentor and a PT.

Telephone communication of HIV testing results for improving knowledge of HIV infection status.	"Background This is one of three Cochrane reviews that examine the role of the telephone in HIV/AIDS services. Both in developed and developing countries there is a large proportion of people who do not know they are infected with HIV. Knowledge of one's own HIV serostatus is necessary to access HIV support, care and treatment and to prevent acquisition or further transmission of HIV. Using telephones instead of face-to-face or other means of HIV test results delivery could lead to more people receiving their HIV test results. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of telephone use for delivery of HIV test results and post-test counselling. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PubMed Central, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health (CINAHL), WHOs The Global Health Library and Current Controlled Trials from 1980 to June 2011. We also searched grey literature sources such as Dissertation Abstracts International,CAB Direct Global Health, OpenSIGLE, The Healthcare Management Information Consortium, Google Scholar, Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, International AIDS Society and AEGIS Education Global Information System, and reference lists of relevant studies for this review. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials (qRCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series (ITS) studies comparing the effectiveness of telephone HIV test results notification and post-test counselling to face-to-face or other ways of HIV test result delivery in people regardless of their demographic characteristics and in all settings. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently searched, screened, assessed study quality and extracted data. A third reviewer resolved any disagreement. Main results Out of 14 717 citations, only one study met the inclusion criteria; an RCT conducted on homeless and high-risk youth between September 1998 and October 1999 in Portland, United States. Participants (n=351) were offered counselling and oral HIV testing and were randomised into face-to-face (n=187 participants) and telephone (n=167) notification groups. The telephone notification group had the option of receiving HIV test results either by telephone or face-to-face. Overall, only 48% (n=168) of participants received their HIV test results and post-test counselling. Significantly more participants received their HIV test results in the telephone notification group compared to the face-to-face notification group; 58% (n=106) vs. 37% (n=62) (p < 0.001). In the telephone notification group, the majority of participants who received their HIV test results did so by telephone (88%, n=93). The study could not offer information about the effectiveness of telephone HIV test notification with HIV-positive participants because only two youth tested positive and both were assigned to the face-to-face notification group. The study had a high risk of bias. Authors' conclusions We found only one eligible study. Although this study showed the use of the telephone for HIV test results notification was more effective than face-to-face delivery, it had a high-risk of bias. The study was conducted about 13 years ago in a high-income country, on a high-risk population, with low HIV prevalence, and the applicability of its results to other settings and contexts is unclear. The study did not provide information about telephone HIV test results notification of HIV positive people since none of the intervention group participants were HIV positive. We found no information about the acceptability of the intervention to patients' and providers', its economic outcomes or potential adverse effects. There is a need for robust evidence from various settings on the effectiveness of telephone use for HIV test results notification."
Telephone delivered interventions for reducing morbidity and mortality in people with HIV infection.	"Background This is one of three Cochrane reviews examining the role of the telephone in HIV/AIDS services. Telephone interventions, delivered either by landline or mobile phone, may be useful in the management of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in many situations. Telephone delivered interventions have the potential to reduce costs, save time and facilitate more support for PLHIV. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of voice landline and mobile telephone delivered interventions for reducing morbidity and mortality in people with HIV infection. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed Central, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health, World Health Organisation's The Global Health Library and Current Controlled Trials from 1980 to June 2011. We searched the following grey literature sources: Dissertation Abstracts International, Centre for Agriculture Bioscience International Direct Global Health database, The System for Information on Grey Literature Europe, The Healthcare Management Information Consortium database, Google Scholar, Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, International AIDS Society, AIDS Educational Global Information System and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series studies comparing the effectiveness of telephone delivered interventions for reducing morbidity and mortality in persons with HIV infection versus in-person interventions or usual care, regardless of demographic characteristics and in all settings. Both mobile and landline telephone interventions were included, but mobile phone messaging interventions were excluded. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently searched, screened, assessed study quality and extracted data. Primary outcomes were change in behaviour, healthcare uptake or clinical outcomes. Secondary outcomes were appropriateness of the mode of communication, and whether underlying factors for change were altered. Meta-analyses, each of three studies, were performed for medication adherence and depressive symptoms. A narrative synthesis is presented for all other outcomes due to study heterogeneity. Main results Out of 14 717 citations, 11 RCTs met the inclusion criteria (1381 participants). Authors' conclusions Telephone voice interventions may have a role in improving medication adherence, reducing risky sexual behaviour, and reducing depressive and psychiatric symptoms, but current evidence is sparse, and further research is needed."
Telephone-based motivational interviewing for medication adherence: a systematic review	"Adherence to prescribed medications continues to be a problem in the treatment of chronic disease. Motivational interviewing (MI) has been shown to be successful for eliciting patients' motivations to change their medication-taking behaviors. Due to the constraints of the US healthcare system, patients do not always have in-person access to providers. Because of this, there is increasing use of non-traditional healthcare delivery methods such as telephonic counseling. A systematic review was conducted among published studies of telephone-based MI interventions aimed at improving the health behavior change target of medication adherence. The goals of this review were to (1) examine and describe evidence and gaps in the literature for telephonically delivered MI interventions for medication adherence and (2) discuss the implications of the findings for research and practice. The MEDLINE, CINAHL, psycINFO, psycARTICLES, Academic Search Premier, Alt HealthWatch, Health Source: Consumer Edition, and Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition databases were searched for peer-reviewed research publications between 1991 and October 2012. A total of nine articles were retained for review. The quality of the studies and the interventions varied significantly, which precluded making definitive conclusions but findings among a majority of retained studies suggest that telephone-based MI may help improve medication adherence. The included studies provided promising results and justification for continued exploration in the provision of MI via telephone encounters. Future research is needed to address gaps in the current literature but the results suggest that MI may be an efficient option for healthcare professionals seeking an evidence-based method to reach remote or inaccessible patients to help them improve their medication adherence."
Telerehabilitation for persons with multiple sclerosis.	"Background: Telerehabilitation, an emerging method, extends rehabilitative care beyond the hospital, and facilitates multifaceted, often psychotherapeutic approaches to modern management of patients using telecommunication technology at home or in the community. Although a wide range of telerehabilitation interventions are trialed in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS), evidence for their effectiveness is unclear. Objectives: To investigate the effectiveness and safety of telerehabilitation intervention in pwMS for improved patient outcomes. Specifically, this review addresses the following questions: does telerehabilitation achieve better outcomes compared with traditional face-to-face intervention; and what types of telerehabilitation interventions are effective, in which setting and influence which specific outcomes (impairment, activity limitation and participation)? Search methods: We performed a literature search using the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Review Group Specialised Register(9 July, 2014.) We handsearched the relevant journals and screened the reference lists of identified studies, and contacted authors for additional data. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that reported telerehabilitation intervention/s in pwMS and compared them with some form of control intervention (such as lower level or different types of intervention, minimal intervention, waiting-list controls or no treatment (or usual care); interventions given in different settings) in adults with MS. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. Three review authors assessed the methodological quality of studies using the GRADEpro software (GRADEpro 2008) for best-evidence synthesis. A meta-analysis was not possible due to marked methodological, clinical and statistical heterogeneity between included trials and between measurement tools used. Hence, we performed a best-evidence synthesis using a qualitative analysis. Main results: Nine RCTs, one with two reports, (N = 531 participants, 469 included in analyses) investigated a variety of telerehabilitation interventions in adults with MS. The mean age of participants varied from 41 to 52 years (mean 46.5 years) and mean years since diagnosis from 7.7 to 19.0 years (mean 12.3 years). The majority of the participants were women (proportion ranging from 56% to 87%, mean 74%) and with a relapsing-remitting course of MS. These interventions were complex, with more than one rehabilitation component and included physical activity, educational, behavioural and symptom management programmes. All studies scored 'low' on the methodological quality assessment. Overall, the review found 'low-level' evidence for telerehabilitation interventions in reducing short-term disability and symptoms such as fatigue. There was also 'low-level' evidence supporting telerehabilitation in the longer term for improved functional activities, impairments (such as fatigue, pain, insomnia); and participation measured by quality of life and psychological outcomes. There were limited data on process evaluation (participants'/therapists' satisfaction) and no data available for cost effectiveness. There were no adverse events reported as a result of telerehabilitation interventions. Authors' conclusions: There is currently limited evidence on the efficacy of telerehabilitation in improving functional activities, fatigue and quality of life in adults with MS. A range of telerehabilitation interventions might be an alternative method of delivering services in MS populations. There is insufficient evidence to support on what types of telerehabilitation interventions are effective, and in which setting. More robust trials are needed to build evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of these interventions."
The benefits of yoga practice compared to physical exercise in the management of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis	"Yoga is increasingly used as an adjunctive therapy in the management of Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The present study aims to systematically evaluate the literature and perform a meta-analysis on the effects of yoga practice compared to physical exercise in the management of T2DM. Data were obtained using a stepwise search process using keywords in the following online medical databases; PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. All controlled clinical trials involving patients with T2DM, comparing yoga as an intervention with physical exercise and evaluating glycaemic control and other outcomes between the intervention and control groups were included in the analysis. Eight studies were eligible to be included in the systematic review. In total, 842 participants were assigned to a Yoga intervention or a control group with an Exercise intervention and the age range of participants was 30-78 years. A significant reduction in FBG (15.16mg/dl), PPBG (28.66mg/dl), HbA1c (0.39%) and BMI (0.71kg/m2) was noted in the intervention group ('Yoga') compared to the control group ('Physical Exercise') in the pooled analysis. We did not observe any significant difference between the two groups for lipid parameters, other body composition measures (WC and WHR) and Blood Pressure. In conclusion, our results show that Yoga has beneficial effects on glycaemic control in comparison to physical exercise in T2DM However, individual studies showed considerable heterogeneity. Hence, further well-controlled randomized trials are required prior to drawing conclusions about the benefits of yoga in comparison to physical exercise. Copyright ¬© 2018 Diabetes India.

The Changing Face of Lung Cancer: Survivor Perspectives on Patient Engagement	"Objective: Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer have resulted in an increasing number of individuals living longer following their diagnosis. No longer is lung cancer the ""death sentence"" it once was. This initiative was designed to document the current experiences of lung cancer patients and explore the potential for patient engagement. Methods: Three avenues of investigation were undertaken: a literature review regarding lung cancer and patient engagement, an environmental scan of lung organizations and cancer societies regarding their approaches to lung cancer patient and family engagement, and in-depth interviews with lung cancer survivors and family members about their experiences and perspectives about patient engagement. Information was collated and major themes identified. Results: Evidence about the experience of lung cancer patients illustrates their needs are complex and dynamic. It also presents a clear picture of unmet physical, psychosocial, and spiritual needs. In particular, stigma is a significant issue for those diagnosed with lung cancer. Information, support, and communication play important roles in helping patients cope but access to resources remains challenging. Patients and family members expressed interest in becoming engaged in advocacy to improve care. Conclusions: The changing face of lung cancer creates the potential for lung cancer survivors to become engaged not only in participating in their own care but also become more involved in peer support and advocacy than lung cancer patients have been able to do in the past."

The effects of landscape patterns on ecosystem services: meta-analyses of landscape services	"Purpose: The recently introduced concept of 'landscape services' - ecosystem services influenced by landscape patterns - may be particularly useful in landscape planning by potentially increasing stakeholder participation and financial funding. However, integrating this concept remains challenging. In order to bypass this barrier, we must gain a greater understanding of how landscape composition and configuration influence the services provided. Methods: We conducted meta-analyses that considered published studies evaluating the effects of several landscape metrics on the following services: pollination, pest control, water quality, disease control, and aesthetic value. We report the cumulative mean effect size (E++), where the signal of the values is related to positive or negative influences. Results: Landscape complexity differentially influenced the provision of services. Particularly, the percentage of natural areas had an effect on natural enemies (E++=0.35), pollination (E++=0.41), and disease control (E++=0.20), while the percentage of no-crop areas had an effect on water quality (E++=0.42) and pest response (E++=0.33). Furthermore, heterogeneity had an effect on aesthetic value (E++=0.5) and water quality (E++=-0.40). Moreover, landscape aggregation was important to explaining pollination (E++=0.29) and water quality (E++=0.35). Conclusions: The meta-analyses reinforce the importance of considering landscape structure in assessing ecosystem services for management purposes and decision-making. The magnitude of landscape effect varies according to the service being studied. Therefore, land managers must account for landscape composition and configuration in order to ensure the maintenance of services and adapt their approach to suit the focal service."
The experiences of people living with epilepsy in developing countries: a systematic review of qualitative evidence	"BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is a global public health problem affecting people of all ages, sex, races, nations and social class. The majority of the 50 million people with epilepsy live in developing countries, with a prevalence rate of five to 10 people per 1000. The disease poses an enormous psychological, social and economic burden on patients. An estimated 90% of people with epilepsy in developing countries do not receive treatment due to sociocultural, economic and political factors. Current treatment interventions are limited to the clinical management of the disease and are largely driven by the healthcare provider's perspective, ignoring the experiences of people living with epilepsy (PLWE). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to identify, critically appraise, extract, synthesize and present the best and most current available evidence on the experiences of PLWE in developing countries. REVIEW QUESTIONS: * What are the experiences of PLWE regarding the causes of their condition?* What are the experiences of PLWE regarding treatment of epilepsy?* How has epilepsy shaped the social relationships of the affected persons? INCLUSION CRITERIA: People living with epilepsy in developing countries (Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America).The experiences of PLWE in developing countries with particular attention on the causes, treatment and its impact on their social relationships.Primary research studies with a qualitative design not limited to phenomenology, ethnography, grounded theory, ethnomethodology, phenomenography, critical theory, interpretative or feminist analysis, case study, narrative studies and action research. CONTEXT: Qualitative studies conducted in hospitals and community settings in developing countries. SEARCH STRATEGY: A three-step search strategy was used to identify published and unpublished studies in the English language from the 1990s to the present. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Identified studies that met the inclusion criteria were retrieved and critically appraised by two independent reviewers prior to their inclusion using the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI). DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted from included papers using the recommended data extraction form embedded in the JBI-QARI. DATA SYNTHESIS: Findings, where possible, were pooled using the JBI-QARI. It involved the meta-aggregation of findings to generate a set of statements that represented that aggregation, through assembling the findings rated according to their quality, and categorizing these findings on the basis of similarity in meaning. RESULTS: From the 13 studies included in the review, 113 findings were extracted to create categories. Eight categories were created from which three synthesized findings were produced. The synthesized findings were: SYNTHESIZED FINDING 1: People living with epilepsy believed that the disease was caused by factors such as fever, demonic power, beatings, witchcraft, curses and God. Patients also had differing views as to whether the disease was contagious or hereditary. They indicated that the disease manifested as seizures, triggered by fever, stress, depression and anger. SYNTHESIZED FINDING 2: People living with epilepsy used biomedical and traditional methods to treat epilepsy and also developed strategies for coping with the disease beyond seeking treatment. SYNTHESIZED FINDING 3: People living with epilepsy had negative and positive experiences in their social relationships. The negative experiences were linked to the social, psychological and economic burden of the disease on patients, whereas the social support they got from friends, peers, family and community members were the positive aspects. CONCLUSION: People living with epilepsy attribute the cause of the disease to agents like fever, demonic power and witchcraft. Patients use biomedical and traditional methods to treat the disease and have also developed various coping strategies (like prayers and concealment) alongside treatment. Epilepsy has negative effects on the social relationships of patients and is a social, psychological and economic burden for patients. However, there are some positive effects like the social support they receive from family members, friends and the community."
The Impact of Canadian School Food Programs on Children's Nutrition and Health: A Systematic Review.	"The quality of children's diets has declined over the past few decades, giving rise to a variety of health-related consequences. In response to this trend, school food programs have become an increasingly effective method to support nutrition and lifelong healthy eating habits. This systematic review synthesizes current academic literature pertaining to school nutrition programs in Canada to identify existing interventions and their impacts on children's nutritional knowledge, dietary behaviour, and food intake. The review was conducted through a search of the following databases: ERIC, Education Source, CINAHL, PubMed, SagePub, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and CBCA. Information extracted from the articles included the program objectives, intervention design and components, research evaluation, and primary outcomes. A total of 11 articles evaluating Canadian school nutrition programs were identified. The programs incorporated a variety of intervention components including policy, education, family and community involvement, and/or food provision. These multi-component interventions were positively associated with children's development of nutrition knowledge, dietary behaviour changes, and intake of healthy foods; however, barriers associated with intervention duration, intensity, and availability of resources may have influenced the extent to which these programs impacted children's diets and overall health."
The impact of community engagement on health and social outcomes: a systematic review	"Community engagement is central to national strategies for promoting health, yet there have been few attempts to systematically review the evidence on the impact of initiatives that aim to engage communities. This rapid review fills this gap by exploring the population impact of initiatives which sought to address social determinants of health. It took a novel approach to synthesizing a sample of the enormous UK literature on community engagement. The synthesis found no evidence of positive impacts on population health or the quality of services, but initiatives did have positive impacts on housing, crime, social capital and community empowerment. Methodological developments are needed to enable studies of complex social interventions to provide robust evidence of population impact in relation to community engagement."
The impact of patient advisors on healthcare outcomes: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Patient advisory councils are a way for healthcare organizations to promote patient engagement. Despite mandates to implement patient advisory councils through programs like the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH), there is a paucity of data measuring the impact of patients functioning in advisory roles. Our objective is to investigate whether patient engagement in patient advisory councils is linked to improvements in clinical quality, patient safety or patient satisfaction. METHODS: We searched PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL and Google Scholar for English language publications between November 2002 to August 2015, using a combination of ""patient advisor"" and ""care outcomes"" search terms. Article selection utilized dual screening facilitated by DistillerSR software, with group discussion to resolve discordance. Observational studies, randomized controlled trials, and case studies were included that described patients serving in an advisory role where primary outcomes were mentioned. Reference lists of included studies and grey literature searches were conducted. Qualitative thematic analysis was performed to synthesize results. RESULTS: Database searching yielded 639 articles total after removing duplicates, with 129 articles meeting full text inclusion criteria. 32 articles were identified for final review, 16 of which were case studies. Advisory roles included patient advisory councils, ad-hoc patient committees, community advisory councils, experience-based co-design, and other. Four practice-based studies from one research group, involving community advisors in the design of public health interventions, found improved clinical outcomes. No prospective experimental studies assessed the impact of patient advisors on patient safety or patient satisfaction. One cluster-randomized RCT showed that patient advisors helped health care planning efforts identify priorities more aligned with the PCMH. Ten case studies reported anecdotal benefit to individual patient advisors. CONCLUSION: Five included studies demonstrate promising methods for evaluating patient engagement in healthcare delivery and describe impacts on clinical outcomes and priority setting. Based on the case studies found, patient advisors tend to contribute to patient-facing services that may affect clinical care but are not easily evaluated. As clinics and hospitals implement patient advisory councils, rigorous evaluation of their programs is needed to support the expansion of system-level patient engagement. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database of the University of York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (ID: 2015: CRD42015030020 )."
The impact of patient and public involvement on UK NHS health care: a systematic review	"PURPOSE: Patient and public involvement (PPI) has become an integral part of health care with its emphasis on including and empowering individuals and communities in the shaping of health and social care services. The aims of this study were to identify the impact of PPI on UK National Health Service (NHS) healthcare services and to identify the economic cost. It also examined how PPI is being defined, theorized and conceptualized, and how the impact of PPI is captured or measured. DATA SOURCES: Seventeen key online databases and websites were searched, e.g. Medline and the King's Fund. STUDY SELECTION: UK studies from 1997 to 2009 which included service user involvement in NHS healthcare services. Date extraction Key themes were identified and a narrative analysis was undertaken. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: The review indicates that PPI has a range of impacts on healthcare services. There is little evidence of any economic analysis of the costs involved. A key limitation of the PPI evidence base is the poor quality of reporting impact. Few studies define PPI, there is little theoretical underpinning or conceptualization reported, there is an absence of robust measurement of impact and descriptive evidence lacked detail. CONCLUSION: There is a need for significant development of the PPI evidence base particularly around guidance for the reporting of user activity and impact. The evidence base needs to be significantly strengthened to ensure the full impact of involving service users in NHS healthcare services is fully understood."
"The importance of community mobilization in interventions to improve sexual, reproductive, and maternal health outcomes: A review of the evidence"	"Community participation, engagement, and mobilization are common components of many sexual, reproductive, and maternal health (SRMH) programs, but little consensus exists among researchers on how critical these program components are. Using principles of realist review, we reviewed a spectrum of community mobilization interventions to evaluate their use in improving five SRMH areas. Consistent with theoretical assumptions, we found that actively involving community members in leading intervention activities and/or taking ownership tends to produce better SRMH outcomes than simply relying on community members as implementers. Despite this, many fewer programs exist with this meaningful level of engagement than with more cursory engagement."
The need for more effective father involvement in early autism intervention: A systematic review and recommendations	"Fathers of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are underrepresented in both early intervention and research. However, fathers have unique interaction styles that make important contributions to the language and symbolic play development of typically developing children. Fathers may make similar contributions to the development of their children with ASD, who struggle with social-communicative deficits, particularly in the areas of language and symbolic play. This article provides a theoretical rationale for enhancing fatherÄìchild involvement in early autism intervention that may lead to improved outcomes in child communication and symbolic play and have cascading benefits for families in reducing stress and enhancing coping mechanisms. To support this rationale, systematic reviews of the literature were conducted to (a) identify the extent of father involvement in parent training programs for children with autism, (b) identify the contributions of parents to the symbolic play outcomes of their children with ASD and other disabilities, and (c) examine differences in stress and coping experienced by mothers and fathers of children with ASD. Finally, possible barriers to father participation in early autism intervention are discussed and recommendations are offered for making parent-implemented early intervention for children with ASD more amenable to fathers.

The patient perspective of diabetes care: a systematic review of stated preference research	"BACKGROUND: The importance of understanding the perspective of patients towards their own care is increasingly recognized, both in clinical practice and in pharmaceutical drug development. Stated preference methods to assess the preference of patients towards different aspects of diabetes treatment have now been applied for over a decade. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to examine how stated preference methods are applied in diabetes care, and to evaluate the value of this information in developing the patient perspective in clinical and policy decisions. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. The information sources were MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, Current Contents, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and EconLit. RESULTS: Three contingent valuation studies and 11 discrete choice experiments were retrieved. The majority of studies were conducted from 2009 onwards, but some date back to 1998. The reasons provided for applying the stated preference methods were to help differentiate between products, or to enable inclusion of the patient's perspective in treatment decisions. The main aspects of treatment examined were related to glucose control, adverse events, and drug administration. The majority of patients preferred glucose control over avoiding minor hypoglycemic events. Patient willingness to pay was above $US100/month for glucose control, avoiding immediate health hazards such as nausea, and oral or inhaled drug administration. Preference towards drug administration was highly associated with previous experience with injectable diabetes medicine. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of a drug to lower glucose levels plays a decisive role in the choice between alternative treatments. Future research should strive to develop questionnaire designs relevant for the decision context of the study. That is, if the aim is to foster shared decision making, in clinical practice or drug development, this should guide the study design. Furthermore, concise reporting of all study dimensions-from the qualitative prework to the analysis stage-is warranted."
The SELFIE framework for integrated care for multi-morbidity: Development and description.	"BACKGROUND: The rise of multi-morbidity constitutes a serious challenge in health and social care organisation that requires a shift from disease- towards person-centred integrated care. The aim of the current study was to develop a conceptual framework that can aid the development, implementation, description, and evaluation of integrated care programmes for multi-morbidity. METHODS: A scoping review and expert discussions were used to identify and structure concepts for integrated care for multi-morbidity. A search of scientific and grey literature was conducted. DISCUSSION: meetings were organised within the SELFIE research project with representatives of five stakeholder groups (5Ps): patients, partners, professionals, payers, and policy makers. RESULTS: In the scientific literature 11,641 publications were identified, 92 were included for data extraction. A draft framework was constructed that was adapted after discussion with SELFIE partners from 8 EU countries and 5P representatives. The core of the framework is the holistic understanding of the person with multi-morbidity in his or her environment. Around the core, concepts were grouped into adapted WHO components of health systems: service delivery, leadership & governance, workforce, financing, technologies & medical products, and information & research. Within each component micro, meso, and macro levels are distinguished. CONCLUSION: The framework structures relevant concepts in integrated care for multi-morbidity and can be applied by different stakeholders to guide development, implementation, description, and evaluation.

The WHO Health Promoting School framework for improving the health and well-being of students and their academic achievement.	"Background The World Health Organization's (WHO's) Health Promoting Schools (HPS) framework is an holistic, settings-based approach to promoting health and educational attainment in school. The effectiveness of this approach has not been previously rigorously reviewed. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of the Health Promoting Schools (HPS) framework in improving the health and well-being of students and their academic achievement. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases in January 2011 and again in March and April 2013: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Campbell Library, ASSIA, BiblioMap, CAB Abstracts, IBSS, Social Science Citation Index, Sociological Abstracts, TRoPHI, Global Health Database, SIGLE, Australian Education Index, British Education Index, Education Resources Information Centre, Database of Education Research, Dissertation Express, Index to Theses in Great Britain and Ireland, and . We also searched relevant websites, handsearched reference lists, and used citation tracking to identify other relevant articles. Selection criteria We included cluster-randomised controlled trials where randomisation took place at the level of school, district or other geographical area. Participants were children and young people aged four to 18 years, attending schools or colleges. In this review, we define HPS interventions as comprising the following three elements: input to the curriculum; changes to the school's ethos or environment or both; and engagement with families or communities, or both. We compared this intervention against schools that implemented either no intervention or continued with their usual practice, or any programme that included just one or two of the above mentioned HPS elements. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors identified relevant trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in the trials. We grouped different types of interventions according to the health topic targeted or the approach used, or both. Where data permitted, we performed random-effects meta-analyses to provide a summary of results across studies. Main results We included 67 eligible cluster trials, randomising 1443 schools or districts. This is made up of 1345 schools and 98 districts. The studies tackled a range of health issues: physical activity (4), nutrition (12), physical activity and nutrition combined (18), bullying (7), tobacco (5), alcohol (2), sexual health (2), violence (2), mental health (2), hand-washing (2), multiple risk behaviours (7), cycle-helmet use (1), eating disorders (1), sun protection (1), and oral health (1). The quality of evidence overall was low to moderate as determined by the GRADE approach. 'Risk of bias' assessments identified methodological limitations, including heavy reliance on self-reported data and high attrition rates for some studies. In addition, there was a lack of long-term follow-up data for most studies. Authors' conclusions The results of this review provide evidence for the effectiveness of some interventions based on the HPS framework for improving certain health outcomes but not others. More well-designed research is required to establish the effectiveness of this approach for other health topics and academic achievement."
Through the eyes of othersÄîThe social experiences of people with dementia: A systematic literature review and synthesis	"Background: Psychosocial models suggest that the lived experience of dementia is affected by interpersonal factors such as the ways in which others view, talk about, and behave toward the person with dementia. This review aimed to illuminate how informal, everyday interpersonal relationships are experienced by people with dementia within their social contexts. Method: A systematic review of qualitative literature published between 1989 and May 2016 was conducted, utilizing the electronic databases PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and CINAHL-Complete. This was followed by a critical interpretative synthesis to understand how people with dementia perceive the attitudes, views, and reactions of other people toward them, and the subjective impact that these have. Results: Four major themes were derived from the findings of the 23 included studies: being treated as an 'other' rather than 'one of us'; being treated as 'lesser' rather than a full, valued member of society; the impact of others"" responses; and strategies to manage the responses of others. Thus, people with dementia can feel outcast and relegated, or indeed feel included and valued by others. These experiences impact upon emotional and psychological well-being, and are actively interpreted and managed by people with dementia. Conclusion: Experiences such as loss and diminishing identity have previously been understood as a direct result of dementia, with little consideration of interpersonal influences. This review notes that people with dementia actively engage with others, whose responses can foster or undermine social well-being. This dynamic relational aspect may contribute to emerging understandings of social health in dementia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"
Tobacco cessation interventions for young people	"Most tobacco control programmes for adolescents are based around prevention of uptake, but teenage smoking is still common. It is unclear if interventions that are effective for adults can also help adolescents to quit. This is the second update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006. To evaluate the effectiveness of strategies that help young people to stop smoking tobacco. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register in February 2013. This includes reports for trials identified in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsyclNFO. We included randomized controlled trials, cluster-randomized controlled trials and other controlled trials recruiting young people, aged less than 20, who were regular tobacco smokers. We included any interventions; these could include pharmacotherapy, psycho-social interventions and complex programmes targeting families, schools or communities. We excluded programmes primarily aimed at prevention of uptake. The primary outcome was smoking status after at least six months follow-up among those who smoked at baseline. Both authors independently assessed the eligibility of candidate trials and extracted data. Included studies were evaluated for risk of bias using standard Cochrane methodology. Where meta-analysis was appropriate, we estimated pooled risk ratios using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method, based on the quit rates at longest follow-up. Twenty-eight trials involving approximately 6000 young people met our inclusion criteria (12 cluster-randomized controlled trials, 14 randomized controlled trials and 2 controlled trials). The majority of studies were judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Many studies combined components from various theoretical backgrounds to form complex interventions.The majority used some form of motivational enhancement combined with psychological support such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and some were tailored to stage of change using the transtheoretical model (TTM). Three trials based mainly on TTM interventions achieved moderate long-term success, with a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 1.56 at one year (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21 to 2.01). The 12 trials that included some form of motivational enhancement gave an estimated RR of 1.60 (95% CI 1.28 to 2.01). None of the 13 individual trials of complex interventions that included cognitive behavioural therapy achieved statistically significant results, and results were not pooled due to clinical heterogeneity. There was a marginally significant effect of pooling six studies of the Not on Tobacco programme (RR of 1.31, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.71), although three of the trials used abstinence for as little as 24 hours at six months as the cessation outcome. A small trial testing nicotine replacement therapy did not detect a statistically significant effect. Two trials of bupropion, one testing two doses and one testing it as an adjunct to NRT, did not detect significant effects. Studies of pharmacotherapies reported some adverse events considered related to study treatment, though most were mild, whereas no adverse events were reported in studies of behavioural interventions. Complex approaches show promise, with some persistence of abstinence (30 days point prevalence abstinence or continuous abstinence at six months), especially those incorporating elements sensitive to stage of change and using motivational enhancement and CBT. Given the episodic nature of adolescent smoking, more data is needed on sustained quitting. There were few trials with evidence about pharmacological interventions (nicotine replacement and bupropion), and none demonstrated effectiveness for adolescent smokers. There is not yet sufficient evidence to recommend widespread implementation of any one model. There continues to be a need for well-designed adequately powered randomized controlled trials of interventions for this population of smokers.CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]"
Toward patient-centered care and inclusive health-care governance: a review of patient empowerment in the UAE.	"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article was twofold. We aimed to both clarify the multidimensional notion of patient empowerment (PE) and conduct a comprehensive survey of PE-related literature in the specific context of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). STUDY DESIGN: The study objectives were achieved by means of a two-phased systematic review of the literature on PE and associated dimensions. METHODS: The first phase consisted in the database search for recent review articles on the construct of PE that were published in the past five years. The second phase focused on the identification of extant empirical research on PE and related concepts in UAE settings. In total, 13 review articles and 17 empirical studies were eligible and included in our analysis. RESULTS: The retained PE review articles pointed to two major themes and four topics on 'conceptual clarification' and 'contextual embeddedness', where PE was tackled in relation to national health-care system, health-care governance, information technology, and therapeutic continuum. Our analysis of UAE-based PE studies unveiled three themes on 'chronic disease care' (with three topics of 'general inquiries', 'diabetes management', and 'diabetic complications'), 'self-medication with drugs', and 'non-therapeutic interventions'. By juxtaposing the identified PE themes and topics, we derived three promising opportunities for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to consolidate, expand, and initiate relevant PE interventions in the UAE. CONCLUSION: This review article found that PE represents an emergent and underexplored notion in the UAE health-care system. As UAE ambitions to become a sought-after medical hub in the global arena, the design and implementation of adequate PE strategies and reforms play a critical role in the development of a world-class patient-centered health care in the country.

Translating cancer prevention and control research into the community setting: workforce implications	"A gap exists between cancer prevention research and its translation into community practice. Two strategies to reduce this gap are community-based participatory research (CBPR) and dissemination research. CBPR offers an avenue to engage academic and community partners, thereby providing mechanisms for joint learning and application of knowledge. Dissemination research examines the movement of evidence-based public health and clinical innovations to practice settings. While applying these approaches may reduce the gap between research and practice, the cancer prevention workforce may be inadequate in size, insufficiently trained, lack resources and incentives, or face structural barriers to effectively participate in CBPR and disseminate evidence-based research findings into practice. Information on translating cancer prevention information to communities and workforce implications was obtained from a panel of experts and through a review of the literature on CBPR and dissemination research. The expert panel and literature review identified major barriers to successfully conducting CBPR and dissemination research in community settings. Barriers included inadequate policies; insufficient networking and communication infrastructures; unsupportive research cultures, climates, and mindsets; inadequate researcher and practitioner education; and limited CBPR and dissemination research with adequate study designs. No specific estimates of the cancer prevention workforce were found; however, indirect evidence for a shortfall were identified. We recommend expanding CBPR training for academic and community partners; increasing funding for dissemination research and practice; supporting proven partnerships; and providing strategic coordination for government agencies, research institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector to foster better dissemination of information and integration of community-based cancer prevention and control programs and practices. Specific challenges and needs that must be addressed to improve the translation of cancer prevention research into community settings were identified."
Understanding the factors that make public participation effective in health policy and planning: a realist synthesis	"Although researchers argue for the importance of involving the public in developing health policy, there has been little focus on central research questions - such as what techniques of public participation work, in what circumstances, and why. This paper presents a realist synthesis which identifies and explains the underlying mechanisms and specific contextual factors that lead to effective public participation in health policy and planning. Peer-reviewed, English language literature was searched, which resulted in 77 articles for review and synthesis. This synthesis uncovered the underlying mechanism of 'political commitment' that generates public participation effectiveness. The other three possible underlying mechanisms, namely: 'partnership synergy', 'inclusiveness' and 'deliberativeness', were found to potentially provide further explanation on public participation effectiveness for health policy and planning. The findings of this review provide evidence that can be useful to health practitioners and decision-makers to actively involve the public when drafting public health policies and programs and, more importantly, guide them in deciding which strategies to best employ for which contexts."
Understanding the social determinants of health among Indigenous Canadians: priorities for health promotion policies and actions	"BACKGROUND: Indigenous Canadians have a life expectancy 12 years lower than the national average and experience higher rates of preventable chronic diseases compared with non-Indigenous Canadians. Transgenerational trauma from past assimilation policies have affected the health of Indigenous populations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively examine the social determinants of health (SDH), in order to identify priorities for health promotion policies and actions. DESIGN: We undertook a series of systematic reviews focusing on four major SDH (i.e. income, education, employment, and housing) among Indigenous peoples in Alberta, following the protocol Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis-Equity. RESULTS: We found that the four SDH disproportionately affect the health of Indigenous peoples. Our systematic review highlighted 1) limited information regarding relationships and interactions among income, personal and social circumstances, and health outcomes; 2) limited knowledge of factors contributing to current housing status and its impacts on health outcomes; and 3) the limited number of studies involving the barriers to, and opportunities for, education. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may help to inform efforts to promote health equity and improve health outcomes of Indigenous Canadians. However, there is still a great need for in-depth subgroup studies to understand SDH (e.g. age, Indigenous ethnicity, dwelling area, etc.) and intersectoral collaborations (e.g. community and various government departments) to reduce health disparities faced by Indigenous Canadians."
Values associated with public involvement in health and social care research: a narrative review	"Background: Much has been written about public involvement (PI) in health and social care research, but underpinning values are rarely made explicit despite the potential for these to have significant influence on the practice and assessment of PI. Objective: The narrative review reported here is part of a larger MRC-funded study which is producing a framework and related guidance on assessing the impact of PI in health and social care research. The review aimed to identify and characterize the range of values associated with PI that are central elements of the framework. Methods: We undertook a review and narrative synthesis of diverse literatures of PI in health and social care research, including twenty existing reviews and twenty-four chapters in sixteen textbooks. Results: Three overarching value systems were identified, each containing five value clusters. (i) A system concerned with ethical and/or political issues including value clusters associated with empowerment; change/action; accountability/transparency; rights; and ethics (normative values). (ii). A system concerned with the consequences of public involvement in research including value clusters associated with effectiveness; quality/relevance; validity/reliability; representativeness/objectivity/generalizability; and evidence (substantive values). (iii) A system concerned with the conduct of public involvement in including value clusters associated with Partnership/equality; respect/trust; openness and honesty; independence; and clarity (process values). Conclusion: Our review identified three systems associated with PI in health and social care research focused on normative, substantive and process values. The findings suggest that research teams should consider and make explicit the values they attach to PI in research and discuss ways in which potential tensions may be managed in order to maximize the benefits of PI for researchers, lay experts and the research."
Vocational rehabilitation: Facilitating evidence based practice through participatory action research	Improving vocational rehabilitation in line with the current evidence base is an area of considerable interest. Aims To describe the strategies used by a multidisciplinary team in the initial stages of a participatory action research (PAR) approach to improving a vocational rehabilitation service.
Web-based intervention programs for depression: a scoping review and evaluation	"BACKGROUND: Although depression is known to affect millions of people worldwide, individuals seeking aid from qualified health care professionals are faced with a number of barriers to treatment including a lack of treatment resources, limited number of qualified service providers, stigma associated with diagnosis and treatment, prolonged wait times, cost, and barriers to accessibility such as transportation and clinic locations. The delivery of depression interventions through the Internet may provide a practical solution to addressing some of these barriers. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this scoping review was to answer the following questions: (1) What Web-delivered programs are currently available that offer an interactive treatment component for depression?, (2) What are the contents, accessibility, and usability of each identified program?, and (3) What tools, supports, and research evidence are available for each identified program? METHODS: Using the popular search engines Google, Yahoo, and Bing (Canadian platforms), two reviewers independently searched for interactive Web-based interventions targeting the treatment of depression. The Beacon website, an information portal for online health applications, was also consulted. For each identified program, accessibility, usability, tools, support, and research evidence were evaluated and programs were categorized as evidence-based versus non-evidence-based if they had been the subject of at least one randomized controlled trial. Programs were scored using a 28-point rating system, and evidence- versus non-evidence-based programs were compared and contrasted. Although this review included all programs meeting exclusion and inclusion criteria found using the described search method, only English language Web-delivered depression programs were awarded an evaluation score. RESULTS: The review identified 32 programs meeting inclusion criteria. There was a great deal of variability among the programs captured in this evaluation. Many of the programs were developed for general adolescent or adult audiences, with few (n=2) focusing on special populations (eg, military personnel, older adults). Cognitive behavioral therapy was the most common therapeutic approach used in the programs described. Program interactive components included mood assessments and supplementary homework sheets such as activity planning and goal setting. Only 12 of the programs had published evidence in support of their efficacy and treatment of depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: There are a number of interactive depression interventions available through the Internet. Recommendations for future programs, or the adaptation of existing programs include offering a greater selection of alternative languages, removing registration restrictions, free trial periods for programs requiring user fees, and amending programs to meet the needs of special populations (eg, those with cognitive and/or visual impairments). Furthermore, discussion of specific and relevant topics to the target audience while also enhancing overall user control would contribute to a more accessible intervention tool."
What are the contents of patient engagement interventions for older adults? A systematic review of randomized controlled trials	"OBJECTIVE: To describe the contents of interventions reported in RCTs focusing on patient engagement of older adults. METHODS: A systematic literature review based on a search for ""patient engagement/activation/empowerment/involvement/participation"". Interventions were classified according to: (i) specific components (micro level), (ii) single/multiple dimensions (educational, behavioral, affective) (meso level), and (iii) the studies' main educational, behavioral or affective dimension (macro level). RESULTS: After screening 2749 articles, 35 were included. 20 unique components were identified, mostly behavioral or educational (45.5% each) (e.g., goal setting or written informational materials). Most interventions with a single-focus were classified as educational (31%), one was solely affective (3%). Half of the interventions covered more than one dimension, with four (11%) combining all three dimensions. Studies mainly focusing on the affective dimension included older participants (72 vs. 67 years), had a higher proportion of females (71% vs. 44%), and included other dimensions more frequently (67% vs. 31%) than did studies with a main focus on the educational dimension. CONCLUSION: The contents of the interventions that focused on patient engagement of older adults tend to focus more on behavioral and educational dimensions than the affective dimension. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The possibility of adding the affective dimension into behavioral and/or educational interventions should be explored. Copyright ¬© 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"What Facilitates ""Patient Empowerment"" in Cancer Patients During Follow-Up: A Qualitative Systematic Review of the Literature"	"Empowerment is a concept of growing importance in cancer care, but little is known about cancer patients' experiences of empowerment during follow-up. To explore this area, a qualitative systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. A total of 2,292 papers were identified and 38 articles selected and included in the review. The thematic synthesis of the papers resulted in seven analytical themes being identified: empowerment as an ongoing process, knowledge is power, having an active role, communication and interaction between patients and health care professionals, support from being in a group, religion and spirituality, and gender. Very few articles explicitly explored the empowerment of cancer patients during follow-up, and the review identified a lack of attention to patients' own understandings of empowerment, a lack of specific focus on empowerment during follow-up, and insufficient attention to collective empowerment, as well as ethnic, social, and gender differences."
"What Is a ""Community Perception"" of REDD+? A Systematic Review of How Perceptions of REDD+ Have Been Elicited and Reported in the Literature."	"Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) is expected to generate co-benefits and safeguard the interests of people who live in the forested regions where emissions are reduced. Participatory measurement, reporting and verification (PMRV) is one way to ensure that the interests of local people are represented in REDD+. In order to design and use PMRV systems to monitor co-benefits and safeguards, we need to obtain input on how local people perceive REDD+. In the literature, this is widely discussed as ""community perceptions of REDD+."" We systematically reviewed this literature to understand how these perceptions have been assessed, focusing specifically on how individual perceptions have been sampled and aggregated into ""community perceptions."" Using Google Scholar, we identified 19 publications that reported community perceptions of REDD+, including perceptions of its design, implementation, impacts, relationship with land tenure, and both interest and actual participation by local people. These perceptions were elicited through surveys of probability samples of the local population and interviews with purposively selected community representatives. Many authors did not provide sufficient information on their methods to interpret the reported community perceptions. For example, there was often insufficient detail on the selection of respondents or sampling methods. Authors also reported perceptions by unquantified magnitudes (e.g., ""most people"", ""the majority"") that were difficult to assess or compare across cases. Given this situation in the scholarly literature, we expect that there are even more severe problems in the voluminous gray literature on REDD+ not indexed by Google Scholar. We suggest that readers need to be cognizant of these issues and that publication outlets should establish guidelines for better reporting, requiring information on the reference population, sampling methods, and methods used to aggregate individual responses into ""community perceptions."""
Women's groups practising participatory learning and action to improve maternal and newborn health in low-resource settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis	"BACKGROUND: Maternal and neonatal mortality rates remain high in many low-income and middle-income countries. Different approaches for the improvement of birth outcomes have been used in community-based interventions, with heterogeneous effects on survival. We assessed the effects of women's groups practising participatory learning and action, compared with usual care, on birth outcomes in low-resource settings. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials undertaken in Bangladesh, India, Malawi, and Nepal in which the effects of women's groups practising participatory learning and action were assessed to identify population-level predictors of effect on maternal mortality, neonatal mortality, and stillbirths. We also reviewed the cost-effectiveness of the women's group intervention and estimated its potential effect at scale in Countdown countries. FINDINGS: Seven trials (119,428 births) met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses of all trials showed that exposure to women's groups was associated with a 37% reduction in maternal mortality (odds ratio 0.63, 95% CI 0.32-0.94), a 23% reduction in neonatal mortality (0.77, 0.65-0.90), and a 9% non-significant reduction in stillbirths (0.91, 0.79-1.03), with high heterogeneity for maternal (I(2)=58.8%, p=0.024) and neonatal results (I(2)=64.7%, p=0.009). In the meta-regression analyses, the proportion of pregnant women in groups was linearly associated with reduction in both maternal and neonatal mortality (p=0.026 and p=0.011, respectively). A subgroup analysis of the four studies in which at least 30% of pregnant women participated in groups showed a 55% reduction in maternal mortality (0.45, 0.17-0.73) and a 33% reduction in neonatal mortality (0.67, 0.59-0.74). The intervention was cost effective by WHO standards and could save an estimated 283,000 newborn infants and 41,100 mothers per year if implemented in rural areas of 74 Countdown countries. INTERPRETATION: With the participation of at least a third of pregnant women and adequate population coverage, women's groups practising participatory learning and action are a cost-effective strategy to improve maternal and neonatal survival in low-resource settings.

Yoga versus non-standard care for schizophrenia.	"Background Yoga is an ancient spiritual practice that originated in India and is currently accepted in the Western world as a form of relaxation and exercise. It has been of interest for people with schizophrenia as an alternative or adjunctive treatment. Objectives To systematically assess the effects of yoga versus non-standard care for people with schizophrenia. Search methods The Information Specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group searched their specialised Trials Register (latest 30 March 2017), which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We searched the references of all included studies. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with schizophrenia and comparing yoga with non-standard care. We included trials that met our selection criteria and reported useable data. Data collection and analysis The review team independently selected studies, assessed quality, and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed-effect models for analyses. We examined data for heterogeneity (I(superscript 2) technique), assessed risk of bias for included studies, and created a 'Summary of findings' table for seven main outcomes of interest using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Main results We were able to include six studies (586 participants). Non-standard care consisted solely of another type of exercise programme. All outcomes were short term (less than six months). There was a clear difference in the outcome leaving the study early (6 RCTs, n=586, RR 0.64 CI 0.49 to 0.83, medium quality evidence) in favour of the yoga group. There were no clear differences between groups for the remaining outcomes. These included mental state (improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, 1 RCT, n=84, RR 0.81 CI 0.62 to 1.07, low quality evidence), social functioning (improvement in Social Occupational Functioning Scale, 1 RCT, n=84, RR 0.90 CI 0.78 to 1.04, low quality evidence), quality of life (mental health) (average change 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) quality-of-life sub-scale, 1 RCT, n=69, MD -5.30 CI -17.78 to 7.18, low quality evidence), physical health, (average change WHOQOL-BREF physical-health sub-scale, 1 RCT, n=69, MD 9.22 CI -0.42 to 18.86, low quality evidence). Only one study reported adverse effects, finding no incidence of adverse events in either treatment group. There were a considerable number of missing outcomes, which included relapse, change in cognition, costs of care, effect on standard care, service intervention, disability, and activities of daily living. Authors' conclusions We found minimal differences between yoga and non-standard care, the latter consisting of another exercise comparator, which could be broadly considered aerobic exercise. Outcomes were largely based on single studies with limited sample sizes and short-term follow-up. Overall, many outcomes were not reported and evidence presented in this review is of low to moderate quality - too weak to indicate that yoga is superior or inferior to non-standard care control for management of people with schizophrenia."
Groping through the fog': a metasynthesis of women's experiences on VBAC (Vaginal birth after Caesarean section).	"BACKGROUND: Vaginal birth after Caesarean section (VBAC) is a relevant question for a large number of women due to the internationally rising Caesarean section (CS) rate. There is a great deal of research based on quantitative studies but few qualitative studies about women's experiences. METHOD: A metasynthesis based on the interpretative meta ethnography method was conducted. The inclusion criterion was peer-review qualitative articles from different disciplines about women's experiences of VBAC. Eleven articles were checked for quality, and eight articles were included in the synthesis. RESULTS: The included studies were from Australia (four), UK (three), and US (one), and studied women's experience in relation to different aspects of VBAC; decision-making whether to give birth vaginally, the influence of health professionals on decision-making, reason for trying a vaginal birth, experiences when choosing VBAC, experiences of giving birth vaginally, and giving birth with CS when preferring VBAC. The main results are presented with the metaphor groping through the fog; for the women the issue of VBAC is like being in a fog, where decision-making and information from the health care system and professionals, both during pregnancy and the birth, is unclear and contrasting. The results are further presented with four themes: 'to be involved in decision about mode of delivery is difficult but important,' 'vaginal birth has several positive aspects mainly described by women,' 'vaginal birth after CS is a risky project,' and 'own strong responsibility for giving birth vaginally'. CONCLUSION: In order to promote VBAC, more studies are needed from different maternity settings and countries about women's experiences. Women need evidence-based information not only about the risks involved but also positive aspects of VBAC."
"Participation': A systematic review of language, definitions, and constructs used in intervention research with children with disabilities."	"Aim: Improving participation of children with disabilities is a priority; however, the participation construct lacks clarity. This systematic review investigated how researchers defined 'participation' and the language used in participation intervention research. Method: Nine health and education databases were searched for intervention studies of children with disabilities that included a participation outcome. Quantitative data were extracted using a customized form, and participation text data were extracted verbatim. Themes were derived using a thematic coding approach. These participation themes were applied to the outcome measures used in the included studies to compare participation language with the methods used to quantify participation changes. Results: Of the 2257 articles retrieved, 25 were included in this review. Five participation themes and nine subthemes were developed. Two themes, attendance and involvement, were directly related to the participation construct. Three additional themes described related concepts: preferences, activity competence, and sense of self. Interpretation: Attendance and involvement seem to describe the essence of the participation concept. The related themes may provide important avenues to enhance participation outcomes. This review highlighted the need for researchers to define the construct under investigation clearly and select measures carefully, as measurement choice is the mechanism through which the concept is operationalized in research."
Practical' resources to support patient and family engagement in healthcare decisions: a scoping review	"BACKGROUND: Extensive literature exists on public involvement or engagement, but what actual tools or guides exist that are practical, tested and easy to use specifically for initiating and implementing patient and family engagement, is uncertain. No comprehensive review and synthesis of general international published or grey literature on this specific topic was found. A systematic scoping review of published and grey literature is, therefore, appropriate for searching through the vast general engagement literature to identify 'patient/family engagement' tools and guides applicable in health organization decision-making, such as within Alberta Health Services in Alberta, Canada. This latter organization requested this search and review to inform the contents of a patient engagement resource kit for patients, providers and leaders. METHODS: Search terms related to 'patient engagement', tools, guides, education and infrastructure or resources, were applied to published literature databases and grey literature search engines. Grey literature also included United States, Australia and Europe where most known public engagement practices exist, and Canada as the location for this study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were set, and include: English documents referencing 'patient engagement' with specific criteria, and published between 1995 and 2011. For document analysis and synthesis, document analysis worksheets were used by three reviewers for the selected 224 published and 193 grey literature documents. Inter-rater reliability was ensured for the final reviews and syntheses of 76 published and 193 grey documents. RESULTS: Seven key themes emerged from the literature synthesis analysis, and were identified for patient, provider and/or leader groups. Articles/items within each theme were clustered under main topic areas of 'tools', 'education' and 'infrastructure'. The synthesis and findings in the literature include 15 different terms and definitions for 'patient engagement', 17 different engagement models, numerous barriers and benefits, and 34 toolkits for various patient engagement and evaluation initiatives. CONCLUSIONS: Patient engagement is very complex. This scoping review for patient/family engagement tools and guides is a good start for a resource inventory and can guide the content development of a patient engagement resource kit to be used by patients/families, healthcare providers and administrators."
Talking the talk or walking the walk?' A bibliometric review of the literature on public involvement in health research published between 1995 and 2009	"Objectives To characterise the literature on public involvement in health research published between 1995 and 2009. Methods Papers were identified from three systematic reviews, one narrative review and two bibliographies. The analysis identified journals where papers were published; countries of lead authors; types of public involved; health topic areas; and stages of research involving the public. Papers were also classified as to whether they were literature reviews or empirical studies; focused on participatory/action research; were qualitative, quantitative or mixed-method. The number of papers published per year was also examined. Findings Of the 683 papers identified, 297 were of USA origin and 223 were of UK origin. Of the 417 empirical papers: (i) participatory/action research approach was dominant, together with qualitative data collection methods; (ii) the stage of research the public was most involved was question identification; (iii) indigenous groups were most commonly involved; (iv) mental health was the most common health topic. Published studies peaked in 2006. Conclusions The present study identifies publication patterns in public involvement in health research and provides evidence to suggest that researchers increasingly are 'walking the walk' with respect to public involvement, with empirical studies consistently out-numbering literature reviews from 1998."
A comparative review of measurement instruments to inform and evaluate effectiveness of disability inclusive development	"Purpose: A review of existing measurement instruments was conducted to examine their suitability to measure disability prevalence and assess quality of life, protection of disability rights and community participation by people with disabilities, specifically within the context of development programs in low and middle-income countries. Methods: From a search of PubMed and the grey literature, potentially relevant measurement instruments were identified and examined for their content and psychometric properties, where possible. Criteria for inclusion were: based on the WHO's International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health (ICF), used quantitative methods, suitable for population-based studies of disability inclusive development in English and published after 1990. Characteristics of existing instruments were analysed according to components of the ICF and quality of life domains. Results: Ten instruments were identified and reviewed according to the criteria listed above. Each version of instruments was analysed separately. Only three instruments included a component on quality of life. Domains from the ICF that were addressed by some but not all instruments included the environment, technology and communication. Conclusion: The measurement instruments reviewed covered the range of elements required to measure disability-inclusion within development contexts. However no single measurement instrument has the capacity to measure both disability prevalence and changes in quality of life according to contemporary disability paradigms. The review of measurement instruments supports the need for developing an instrument specifically intended to measure disability inclusive practice within development programs."

A comprehensive systematic review of the development process of 104 patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for physical activity in chronically ill and elderly people	"BACKGROUND: Capturing dimensions of physical activity relevant to patients may provide a unique perspective for clinical studies of chronically ill patients. However, the quality of the development of existing instruments is uncertain. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the development process of patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments including their initial validation to measure physical activity in chronically ill or elderly patient populations. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search of electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Psychinfo, Cinahl) and hand searches. We included studies describing the original development of fully structured instruments measuring dimensions of physical activity or related constructs in chronically ills or elderly. We broadened the population to elderly because they are likely to share physical activity limitations. At least two reviewers independently conducted title and abstract screening and full text assessment. We evaluated instruments in terms of their aim, items identification and selection, domain development, test-retest reliability, internal consistency, validity and responsiveness. RESULTS: Of the 2542 references from the database search and 89 from the hand search, 103 full texts which covered 104 instruments met our inclusion criteria. For almost half of the instruments the authors clearly described the aim of the instruments before the scales were developed. For item identification, patient input was used in 38% of the instruments and in 32% adaptation of existing scales and/or unsystematic literature searches were the only sources for the generation of items. For item reduction, in 56% of the instruments patient input was used and in 33% the item reduction process was not clearly described. Test-retest reliability was assessed for 61%, validity for 85% and responsiveness to change for 19% of the instruments. CONCLUSIONS: Many PRO instruments exist to measure dimensions of physical activity in chronically ill and elderly patient populations, which reflects the relevance of this outcome. However, the development processes often lacked definitions of the instruments' aims and patient input. If PROs for physical activity were to be used in clinical trials more attention needs to be paid to the establishment of content validity through patient input and to the assessment of their evaluative measurement properties."
A critical hybrid realist-outcomes systematic review of relationships between medical education programmes and communities: BEME Guide No. 35	"BACKGROUND: The relationships between medical schools and communities have long inspired and troubled medical education programmes. Successive models of community-oriented, community-based and community-engaged medical education have promised much and delivered to varying degrees. A two-armed realist systematic review was undertaken to explore and synthesize the evidence on medical school-community relationships. METHOD: One arm used standard outcomes criteria (Kirkpatrick levels), the other a realist approach seeking out the underlying contexts, mechanisms and outcomes. 38 reviewers completed 489 realist reviews and 271 outcomes reviews; 334 articles were reviewed in the realist arm and 181 in the outcomes arm. Analyses were based on: descriptive statistics on both articles and reviews; the outcomes involved; the quality of the evidence presented; realist contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes; and an analysis of underlying discursive themes. FINDINGS: The literature on medical school-community relationships is heterogeneous and largely idiographic, with no common standards for what a community is, who represents communities, what a relationship is based on, or whose needs are or should be being addressed or considered. CONCLUSIONS: Community relationships can benefit medical education, even if it is not always clear why or how. There is much opportunity to improve the quality and precision of scholarship in this area."
A critical synthesis of barriers and facilitators to the use of AAC by children with autism spectrum disorder and their communication partners	"The aim of this review was to critically synthesize barriers and facilitators to the use of AAC systems by children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their communication partners. Qualitative data related to barriers and facilitators were synthesized from 42 studies located using a systematic search. A diverse range of studies was examined in order to identify the span of barriers and facilitators reported in the literature. Included studies comprised quasi-experimental, non-experimental, and qualitative study designs. The full range of unaided, low-tech aided, and high-tech aided AAC systems were reported across the included studies. The critical synthesis identified 5 themes to which barriers and facilitators are related: (a) Intervention Services and Service Providers, (b) AAC Systems and Technologies (c), Communication Partners of Children with ASD, (d) Parents of Children with ASD, and (e) Children with ASD. The findings suggest that barriers and facilitators to the use of AAC vary across individuals, AAC modalities, and environments. By identifying barriers and facilitators to the use of AAC experienced by children with ASD and their communication partners, service providers might be better equipped to support these children and their communication partners. Clinical implications and future research directions are discussed."
"A decade of research in Inuit children, youth, and maternal health in Canada: areas of concentrations and scarcities"	"Inuit Canadians are on average about 20 years younger and have a 10-year lower life expectancy than other Canadians. While there have been improvements in Inuit health status over time, significant health disparities still remain. This paper will review the peer-reviewed literature related to Inuit child, youth, and maternal health between 2000 and 2010, investigate which thematic areas were examined, and determine what proportion of the research is related to each group. Establishing areas of research concentrations and scarcities may help direct future research where it is needed. We followed a systematic literature review and employed peer-reviewed research literature on child, youth, and maternal health which were selected from 3 sources, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Circumpolar Health Bibliographic Database. The resulting references were read, and summarized according to population group and thematic area. The thematic areas that emerged by frequency were: infectious disease; environment/environmental exposures; nutrition; birth outcomes; tobacco; chronic disease; health care; policy, human resources; interventions/programming; social determinants of health; mental health and wellbeing; genetics; injury; and dental health. The 72 papers that met the inclusion criteria were not mutually exclusive with respect to group studied. Fifty-nine papers (82%) concerned child health, 24 papers (33%) youth health, and 58 papers (81%) maternal health. The review documented high incidences of illness and significant public health problems; however, in the context of these issues, opportunities to develop research that could directly enhance health outcomes are explored."
A Labor of Love	"Evidence suggests that emotional distress and objective demands of cancer caregiving are comparable to those of dementia caregiving, yet little research has focused on the physical health of cancer caregivers. Whether the stress leads directly to changes in health or whether the stress leads to changes in health behaviors, which in turn affect health, has not been systematically examined.The objective of this study was to review the research literature regarding changes in health behaviors associated with caring for an individual with cancer.Literature was reviewed from multiple databases including CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), CINAHL Plus, PsycNET, PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Key words included Äúhealth behavior,Äù Äúhealth promotion,Äù Äùcaregivers/caregiving,Äù Äúcancer/oncology,Äù Äúdiet/nutrition,Äù Äúexercise/physical activity,Äù Äústress management,Äù ÄúsmokingÄù and Äúalcohol.Äù Studies were included if they involved informal adult caregivers and at least 1 behavior associated with a healthy lifestyle. Of the 866 studies identified, 8 met the criteria.Studies revealed conflicting information, with some suggesting deleterious changes in behaviors, whereas others found the changes protective.The lack of uniformity of terminology and conflicting findings make it difficult to conclude the impact of the caregiving experience on the health behaviors of cancer caregivers. Something is placing caregivers at risk for illness and early death, but the mechanisms behind the risk and the role of unhealthy behaviors are not clear.At a minimum, cancer caregivers should be screened for behavior changes and disease risk. Developing standardized measures for future research including controlled, longitudinal studies is needed."
A long way to go: a systematic review to assess the utilisation of sexual and reproductive health services during humanitarian crises.	"Introduction: Women and girls are affected significantly in both sudden and slow-onset emergencies, and face multiple sexual and reproductive health (SRH) challenges in humanitarian crises contexts. There are an estimated 26 million women and girls of reproductive age living in humanitarian crises settings, all of whom need access to SRH information and services. This systematic review aimed to assess the utilisation of services of SRH interventions from the onset of emergencies in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: We searched for both quantitative and qualitative studies in peer-reviewed journals across the following four databases: EMBASE, Global Health, MEDLINE and PsychINFO from 1 January 1980 to 10 April 2017. Primary outcomes of interest included self-reported use and/or confirmed use of the Minimum Initial Service Package services and abortion services. Two authors independently extracted and analysed data from published papers on the effect of SRH interventions on a range of SRH care utilisation outcomes from the onset of emergencies, and used a narrative synthesis approach. Results: Of the 2404 identified citations, 23 studies met the inclusion criteria. 52.1% of the studies (n=12) used quasi-experimental study designs, which provided some statistical measure of difference between intervention and outcome. 39.1% of the studies (n=9) selected were graded as high quality, 39.1% moderate quality (n=9) and 17.4% low quality (n=4). Evidence of effectiveness in increasing service utilisation was available for the following interventions: peer-led and interpersonal education and mass media campaigns, community-based programming and three-tiered network of community-based reproductive and maternal health providers. Conclusions: Despite increased attention to SRH service provision in humanitarian crises settings, the evidence base is still very limited. More implementation research is required to identify interventions to increase utilisation of SRH services in diverse humanitarian crises settings and populations."
"A meta-analysis of the association between patients"" early perception of treatment credibility and their posttreatment outcomes"	"Patients"" perception of treatment credibility represents their belief about a treatment""s personal logicality, suitability, and efficaciousness. Although long considered an important common factor bearing on clinical outcome, there have been no systematic reviews of the credibilityÄìoutcome association. The present study represents a meta-analysis of the association between patients"" credibility perception and their posttreatment outcomes. To be included, articles published through August, 2017 had to (a) include a clinical sample, (b) include a therapist-delivered treatment of at least 3 sessions, (c) include a measure of patients"" own early treatment credibility perception, (d) include at least 1 posttreatment mental health outcome not explicitly referenced as a follow-up occasion, and (e) report a statistical test of the credibilityÄìoutcome association. The meta-analysis was conducted on 24 independent samples (extracted from 19 references) with 1,504 patients. The overall weighted effect size was r = .12, p < .001, or d = .24, with high heterogeneity (I2 = 57%) and no evidence of publication bias. There were no significant moderating effects on the credibilityÄìoutcome association for any of the potential moderators that we evaluated.

"A meta-analysis of the association between patients"" early treatment outcome expectation and their posttreatment outcomes"	"Patients"" outcome expectation (OE) represents their belief about the mental health consequences of participating in psychotherapy. A previous meta-analysis of 46 independent samples receiving the treatment of at least 3 sessions revealed a significant association between more optimistic baseline, or early treatment, OE and more adaptive posttreatment outcomes (weighted r = .12 or d = .24; Constantino, Glass, Arnkoff, Ametrano, & Smith, 2011). The present study represents an update to that meta-analysis. To be included, articles published through June 2017 had to (a) include a clinical sample, (b) include a therapist-delivered treatment of at least 3 sessions, (c) include a measure of patients"" own OE, (d) include at least 1 posttreatment mental health outcome not explicitly referenced as a follow-up occasion, and (e) report a statistical test of the OEàíoutcome association.

A meta-ethnographic synthesis of fathers' experiences of complicated births that are potentially traumatic	"Introduction: birth is a natural and for many, life enhancing phenomenon. In rare circumstances however birth can be accompanied with complications that may place the mother and infant at risk of severe trauma or death. Witnessing birth complications or obstetric emergencies can be distressing and potentially traumatic for the father. Aim: the aim of this paper is to report on the findings of a meta-ethnographic synthesis of father's experiences of complicated births that are potentially traumatic. Methods: databases searched included CINAHL, Scopus, PubMed and PsycINFO with Full Text. The search was conducted in February and March 2013 and revised in February 2015 for any new papers, and the search was limited to papers published in English, full text and peer-reviewed journals published between January 2000 to December 2013. Inclusion criteria: studies were included if they focused on fathers/men's experiences of witnessing a birth with complications including a caesarean section or an adverse obstetric event. Studies included needed to use qualitative or mixed methods research designs with a substantial qualitative component. Analytic strategy: a meta-ethnographic approach was used using methods of reciprocal translation guided by the work of Noblit and Hare (1988) on meta-ethnographic techniques. Quality appraisal was undertaken using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool. Findings: eight qualitative studies with a total of 100 participants were included in the final sample. The men ranged in age from 19 to 50 years. Synthesis: Four major themes were identified: 'the unfolding crisis', 'stripped of my role: powerless and helpless', 'craving information' and 'scarring the relationship'. Participants described the fear and anxiety they felt as well as having a sense of worthlessness and inadequacy. Men did not receive sufficient information about the unfolding events and subsequently this birth experience impacted on some men's interactions and relationships with their partners. Conclusions: witnessing a complicated or unexpected adverse birth experience can be distressing for men and some may report symptoms of birth trauma. Being informed by and receiving support from midwives and other health professionals appears to help mitigate the negative impact of birth complications. Effective support may help address men's confusion about their role, however genuinely including men as recipients of care or service in pregnancy, labour and birth raises important questions about whether the father is also a recipient of maternity care and if the transition to fatherhood is itself becoming a medical event?"
A meta-review of Internet computer-based psychological treatments for anxiety disorders	"INTRODUCTION: Internet computer-based psychological treatments have enjoyed rapid growth. Today, there are a number of them available for many mental disorders and psychological problems. Internet-based psychological treatments for anxiety disorders and phobias are amongst the most frequently observed. Treatment results with these resources are promising, but inconclusive. METHODS: This paper reviews 11 systematic reviews and meta-analyses about the efficacy of Internet-based psychological treatments for anxiety disorders, including studies and clinical trials covering the majority of anxiety disorders and phobias, usually with adult patient samples. RESULTS: In general, these reviews agree on the efficacy of Internet-based psychological treatment as compared with non-treatment groups (with large effect sizes), finding similar efficacy compared with face-to-face therapies. Internet-based psychological treatments are further improved when combined with some type of therapist contact. On the negative side, some systematic reviews highlight high attrition rates of Internet-based psychological treatments. DISCUSSION: These findings remain inconclusive and more refined reviews (involving patient samples, therapy comparisons, type of therapist contact, etc.) are needed, in order to establish the scope and limits of Internet-based psychological treatments for anxiety disorders.

A meta-synthesis of women's experiences of cesarean birth.	"PURPOSE: The cesarean birth rate has increased dramatically over the past 10 years. With such a large number of women having a cesarean birth, it is important to understand the woman's experience of a cesarean birth and postoperative recovery. A meta-synthesis was conducted to allow for a deeper interpretation of prior qualitative research findings and thus produce a more comprehensive understanding of women's emotional and physical needs when having a cesarean birth. METHOD: Qualitative studies that were published between 2000 and 2010 and were about women's experiences with cesarean births were eligible. A meta-synthesis of 10 qualitative studies was conducted. The studies created a combined sample of 3,721 nulliparous and multiparous women, 16 to 43 years of age. RESULTS: The following six overarching themes emerged: scared to death, in your hands, out of control, broken body and soul, empty heart and arms, and shattered dreams. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: It is important for healthcare professionals to realize women experience similar physical and emotional difficulties irrespective of whether the cesarean was emergent or planned. The overarching themes of (a) in your hands and (b) scared to death reveal the importance of assessing the woman's level of knowledge about cesarean birth throughout the pregnancy so misconceptions can be rectified and correct information can be provided. Healthcare professionals need to be aware of the differences in perspectives about the care provided."
A meta-ethnography of the facilitators and barriers to successful implementation of patient complaints processes in health-care settings	"Abstract: Objective: To synthesize experiences of the patient complaints process for patients and health-care professionals to identify facilitators and barriers in the successful implementation of patient complaints processes. This will assist the development of cultural change programmes, enabling complaints managers to incorporate stakeholder perspectives into future care. Design: Systematic literature search and meta-ethnography, comprising reciprocal syntheses of ÄúpatientÄù and ÄúprofessionalÄù qualitative studies, combined to form a Äúline-of-argumentÄù embodying both perspectives. Data sources: MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO (database inception to April 2015) were searched to identify international literature in primary and secondary health-care settings, involving qualitative data collection and analysis. Further studies were identified from hand-searching relevant journals, contacting authors, article reference lists and Google Scholar. Results: A total of 13 papers, reporting 9 studies from the United Kingdom, Sweden, Australia and New Zealand, were included in the synthesis. Facilitators and barriers to the successful implementation of patient complaints processes were identified across the perspectives of both patients and health-care professionals. Patients sought to individualize the complaints process by targeting specific professionals who engaged in practices that undermined the identity of patients. In contrast, professionals obscured their own individualism through maintaining a collective identity and withholding personal judgement in relation to patient complaints. Conclusions: Complainants recognized health-care professionals as bearers of individual accountability for unsatisfactory care, in opposition to the stance of collective responsibility endorsed by professionals. Implementation of patient complaints processes must reconcile the need for individualized resolution, whilst striving to improve the future provision of health care through a collaborative approach between patients and professionals."
A narrative review of fathers' involvement during labour and birth and their influence on decision making	"Objective: to identify and critically review the research literature that has examined fathers' involvement during labour and birth and their influence on decision making. Design: the review follows the approach of a narrative review. Systematic searches of electronic databases Social Services Abstract, Sociological Abstracts, ASSIA, CINAHL Medline, Cochrane library, AMED, BNI, PsycINFO, Embase, Maternity and Infant care, DH-Data and the Kings Fund Database were combined with manual searches of key journals and reference lists. Studies published between 1992 and 2013 examining fathers' involvement during intrapartum care were included in the review. Findings: the findings of this review suggest that fathers' level of involvement during labour ranges from being a witness or passive observer of labour and birth to having an active supporting and coaching role. The findings also suggest that there are a number of facilitators and barriers to fathers' involvement during labour and birth. There are a limited number of studies that have examined fathers' involvement in decision making and specifically how fathers' influence decision making during labour and birth. Key conclusions: future research needs to address the gap in the literature regarding fathers' involvement and influence on decision making to help midwives and obstetricians understand the process in order enhance the transition to parenthood for women and men."
A public health approach to mobilizing community partners for injury prevention: A scoping review.	"OBJECTIVES: Reducing injuries in adults requires work with diverse stakeholders across many sectors and at multiple levels. At the local level, public health professionals need to effectively bring together, facilitate, and support community partners to initiate evidence-based efforts. However, there has been no formal review of the literature to inform how these professionals can best create action among community partners to address injuries in adults. Thus, this scoping review aims to identify theories, models or frameworks that are applicable to a community-based approach to injury prevention. METHODS: Searches of scientific and less formal literature identified 13,756 relevant items published in the English language between 2000 and 2016 in North America, Europe and Australia. After screening and review, 10 publications were included that (1) identified a theory, framework or model related to mobilizing partners; and (2) referred to community-based adult injury prevention. RESULTS: Findings show that use of theories, frameworks and models in community-based injury prevention programs is rare and often undocumented. One theory and various conceptual models and frameworks exist for mobilizing partners to jointly prevent injuries; however, there are few evaluations of the processes to create community action. CONCLUSIONS: Successful community-based injury prevention must build on what is already understood about creating partnership action. Evaluating local public health professional injury prevention practice based on available theories, models and frameworks will identify successes and challenges to inform process improvements. We propose a logic model to more specifically guide and evaluate how public health can work locally with community partners."
A qualitative review of Patient and Family Advisory Councils in cancer care	"Patient and Family Advisory Councils are organizations that empower patients and their family members to be engaged in improving standards of health care. Patients and family members on these councils provide feedback about their experiences with the hospital, and work together with hospital staff members to address needs and develop initiatives. Objective: This scoping review will summarize the history of Patient and Family Advisory Councils, qualitatively compare and analyze their implementation into cancer care centers in North America. Methods: A search for literature relevant to Patient and Family Advisory Councils and palliative cancer care was conducted across MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central databases. Details about the Patient and Family Advisory Councils in the top 10 United States cancer hospitals as ranked by news sources were also extracted from each hospital""s website. Results: Patient and Family Advisory Councils have been recently implemented at most top cancer hospitals. They have similar meeting frequencies across all hospitals, but other organizational details such as leadership vary. These councils have managed to address many patient needs and contribute to a variety of patient-centered initiatives. Conclusion: There is a paucity of actual quantitative research data available addressing the efficacy of Patient and Family Advisory Councils in cancer care centers; however, the data available suggests that PFACs are playing an important role in the drive for healthcare institutions to become more patient-centered.

A Qualitative Systematic Review of Public-Private Partnership in Promoting Physical Activity.	"The purpose of the study is to conduct a comprehensive review of public-private partnership (PPP) literature that pertains to promoting physical activity. A qualitative systematic review guided data search and screening process, and the findings were synthesized and interpreted using a qualitative content analysis method. Literature was searched from 16 academic and 6 gray literature databases. A total of 1,117 articles were initially searched, full texts of 186 articles were assessed, and 13 articles that met the inclusion criteria were finally included. PPPs have been initiated in various contexts including implementing the pledge policy, program coordination, and infrastructure supports. Public-sector partners were identified in a range of vertical and horizontal levels. Private partners were mainly manufacturers and/or retailers related to physical activity, sport facility operators, professional sport teams, or companies for providing infrastructures for active transportation. Public and private organizations have performed various roles of funding the initiatives, developing and implementing diverse resources, and taking actions to deliver benefits to the communities. Several challenges were reported when developing, implementing, and evaluating the partnership initiatives. The outcomes of the current review can be utilized to anticipate pragmatic issues when public and private partners jointly participate in physical activity promotion."
A qualitative systematic review on the experiences of self-management in community-dwelling older women living with chronic illnesses.	"BACKGROUND: With the risk of chronic conditions increasing with age, older women are likely to have co-morbid chronic conditions. In addition, they may have to contend with socioeconomic issues unique to their gender which can challenge their self-management. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the systematic review was to determine the best available evidence related to the experiences of self-management among community-dwelling older women with chronic conditions, specifically non-communicable illnesses which include cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus and arthritis. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Types of participants included all older women with the following characteristics: aged sixty-five years and above; living in their own community dwellings; community setting rural, suburban or urban; living alone or with others; having co-morbidities and having chronic illnesses for a minimum of one year. Phenomenon of interest was experiences of self-management among community-dwelling older women with chronic conditions. Interpretive studies were considered in the review, which included but were not limited to designs like phenomenology, grounded theory, action research, feminist research and ethnography. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy aimed to uncover both published and unpublished studies, in English language only, and was unrestricted by time. The databases searched included CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO (Ovid), Scopus, Embase, Science Direct, Sociological Abstracts, Social Sciences Citation Index (Web of Science), Proquest and Google Scholar. Preliminary keywords were drawn from the topic of the systematic review. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Each paper was assessed independently by two reviewers for methodological quality. The Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument QARI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Interpretive & Critical Research was used to appraise the methodological quality of all papers. DATA COLLECTION: Qualitative data were extracted from papers included in the review using standardized data extraction tools developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA SYNTHESIS: Qualitative research findings were synthesized using the Joanna Briggs Institute-Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. RESULTS: 88 findings from six studies were aggregated into 22 categories, and then into five synthesized findings. The five synthesized findings are: (i) losing control over a failing body, (ii) maintaining control, (iii) developing self-expertise, (iv) re-defining health, and (v) relying on social support. CONCLUSIONS: For these women, self-management involves reclaiming and maintaining their sense of control over their bodies, which is constantly threatened by their chronic illnesses. In addition, they redefine their meaning of health in the context of illness to maintain their emotional well-being in spite of their illness.Healthcare providers can assist their older female patients in maintaining their sense of control through effective symptom management and practical strategies to manage daily life. Because social support is crucial to self-management by older women, healthcare providers should include, where relevant, family members and other loved ones in patient education. Healthcare providers should also endeavour to build and maintain a positive relationship with their patients through effective communication as the provider-patient relationship is a strong influence on an older woman's experience in self-management.Further research is warranted in older women of other cultural backgrounds as the majority of reviewed studies focused on Caucasians in the United States."
A realist synthesis of controlled studies to determine the effectiveness of interventions to prevent genital cutting of girls.	"Background: Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is a traditional practice which involves the partial or total removal or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. Although current trends indicate that the practice is becoming less prevalent,as many as 30 million girls may still be at risk of FGM/ C. Given the associated risks and violation of the human rights of girls and women,the practice is discouraged through preventative interventions. Aims: To systematically review the effectiveness of anti-FGM/C interventions,applying a realist perspective. Methods: The realist synthesis approach addressed context-mechanisms-outcomes (CMO) underlying intervention in an attempt to explain interventions' success or lack thereof. The process involved exposed the usefulness of strategies in different contexts. Results: Eight effectiveness studies and 27 context studies were included. All of the effectiveness studies employed a controlled,before-and-after study design. They formed five broad categories of intervention: training,formal classroom education,media communication,outreach and advocacy,and informal adult education. The CMO configurations showed that the proposed engine behind changing behaviours regarding FGM/C appeared largely to be dissemination of information. Some interventions' acceptability and success rested on the incorporation of FGM/C abandonment efforts within a larger set of related issues. However,greater success of the interventions could have materialised with systematic pre-planning involving thorough community analyses and securing religious leaders' commitment to halting FGM/C. Conclusion: The results of this analysis point to conditions that facilitate the success of FGM/C abandonment programmes in different contexts and can be used in future prevention efforts to reduce the risk of girls being subjected to FGM/C. ¬© W.

"A review of community engagement in cancer control studies among Indigenous people of Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA"	"MILLER J., KNOTT V.E., WILSON C. & RODER D. (2012) European Journal of Cancer Care 21, 283-295 A review of community engagement in cancer control studies among Indigenous people of Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA This review aimed to address studies of cancer control in Indigenous populations, with a focus on: (1) the nature and extent of community engagement; and (2) the extent to which community engagement has facilitated successful outcomes. Articles addressing Indigenous cancer control using some degree of community engagement were identified by a search of the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (via Ovid and Pubmed), psycINFO, CINAHL and Google Scholar. Relevant studies were scored and analysed according to Green et al.'s guidelines for participatory research. Studies often engaged the community only minimally. Where studies resulted in successful outcomes, they tended to have included Indigenous community members in genuine research roles, from planning, to implementation, to presentation of results at conferences. Studies with positive health outcomes were often initiated by a combination of academic researchers and community members or organisations. This narrative review highlighted significant scope for improvement in community-based studies addressing Indigenous cancer control. Increased attention to the philosophical underpinnings of community engagement is required to ensure that the benefits of this approach are translated to achieve improved cancer control outcomes. An increased awareness of the benefits of community engagement may prove effective in conducting cancer control research that leads to improved outcomes in Indigenous communities."
A review of community-based participatory research in child health	"OBJECTIVE: To review published studies that use an authentic community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach in child health to highlight the benefits, barriers, and scope of this approach with pediatric populations. METHOD: Studies using CBPR in child health were identified using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science through MeSH heading and keyword searches. Keywords included ""community-based participatory research"" and ""child,"" ""youth,"" and ""adolescent."" Literature reviews and community-placed articles were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 34 CBPR studies focused on child health were identified and analyzed for this review. The most common child health issue in these studies was obesity/diabetes. Other child health topics included health needs assessments, reproductive health, female health, HIV treatment, physical activity, mental health, maternal/child health, substance abuse, asthma, and youth with disabilities/special healthcare needs. IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSION: CBPR offers a unique approach for translating evidence-based models and research knowledge from child health into effective and sustainable interventions."

A review of factors influencing participation in social and community activities for wheelchair users	"OBJECTIVE: To systematically identify factors associated with participation in social and community activities for adult wheelchair users (WCUs). DATA SOURCES: PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and EMBASE. STUDY SELECTION: Quantitative and qualitative peer-reviewed publications were included, which were written in English, reported original research and investigated factors associated with social and community participation in adult WCUs. DATA EXTRACTION: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were used. Factors were organized using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty-five studies were selected: two of power WCUs, 10 of manual WCUs and 23 of both. Six qualitative studies, ranging in quality from 8/10 to 9/10 and 29 quantitative studies were included, ranging in quality from 4/15 to 11/15. Fifteen body function, 4 activity, 5 participation, 15 environmental and 14 personal factors were found to be associated with social and community participation. CONCLUSIONS: Social and community participation of WCUs is associated with factors from all ICF domains. Wheelchair factors, accessibility, skills with wheelchair use, pain, finances and education are modifiable factors frequently reported to be associated with participation. Experimental research focusing on modifiable factors is needed to further our understanding of factors influencing participation among WCUs. Implications for Rehabilitation Wheelchair factors, including comfort and durability, are associated with participation and may be targeted in clinical intervention. Wheelchair skills are clinically modifiable and have been shown to improve participation in manual wheelchair users. Body functions (e.g. confidence, depression and fatigue) and personal factors (e.g. finances and level of education) may be considered for clinical intervention."
A review of methods and tools to assess the implementation of government policies to create healthy food environments for preventing obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases	"BACKGROUND: Policies to create healthy food environments are recognized as critical components of efforts to prevent obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. There has not been a systematic review of existing methods and tools used to assess the implementation of these government policies. The purpose of this study was to review methods and tools used for assessing the implementation of government policies to create healthy food environments. The study conducted a systematic literature search. Multiple databases as well as the grey literature were searched. All study designs and review papers on assessing the implementation of government policies to create healthy food environments were included. A quality assessment of the methods and tools identified from relevant studies was carried out using the following four criteria: comprehensiveness, relevance, generalizability and feasibility. This quality assessment was completed by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: The review identified 52 studies across different policy areas, levels and settings. Self-administered questionnaires and policy checklists were most commonly applied to assess the extent of policy implementation, whereas semi-structured interviews were most commonly used to evaluate the implementation process. Measures varied widely, with the existence of policy implementation the aspect most commonly assessed. The most frequently identified barriers and facilitators for policy implementation were infrastructure support, resources and stakeholder engagement. The assessment of policy implementation on food environments was usually undertaken in combination with other policy areas, particularly nutrition education and physical activity. Three tools/methods were rated 'high' quality and 13 tools/methods received 'medium' quality ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Harmonization of the available high-quality methods and tools is needed to ensure that assessment of government policy implementation can be compared across different countries and settings and over time. This will contribute to efforts to increase government accountability for their actions to improve the healthiness of food environments."
"A Review of Psychoeducational Interventions to Improve Sexual Functioning, Quality of Life, and Psychological Outcomes in Gynecological Cancer Patients"	"Background: Psychoeducational interventions are recommended for use with clinical gynecological cancer patients to improve their patient care outcomes. However, the evidence of their effectiveness is far from conclusive. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the best available research evidence related to the effects of psychoeducational interventions on sexual functioning, quality of life, and psychological outcomes in gynecological cancer patients. Methods: A systematic search was conducted to identify English and Chinese articles from the inception of the databases to April 2012 and included 13 English databases and 7 Chinese databases. Gray literature or unpublished studies were also searched. Results: A total of 11 studies involving 975 gynecological cancer patients were included in the review. Meta-analysis results for 4 comparable studies indicated that psychoeducational interventions were effective in treating depressive symptoms among gynecological cancer patients (standardized mean difference = j0.80; 95% confidence interval, j1.05 to j0.54), whereas information provision significantly improved the mental aspect of quality of life (standardized mean difference = j0.41; 95% confidence interval, j0.74 to j0.08). With regard to sexual functioning, psychoeducational interventions appeared to have benefits in improving the sexual life of patients. Conclusions: Findings confirm the effectiveness of psychoeducational interventions on depressive symptoms and mental aspect of the quality of life in gynecological cancer patients. Implications for Practice: The authors discuss the implications of review findings for the effective design of psychoeducational interventions including components, provider, provision time frame, and duration for clinical practice, as well as psychoeducational intervention research."
"A review of trends in Indigenous Australian tobacco research (from 2004 to 2013), its associated outputs and evidence of research translation."	"Introduction: Smoking prevalence among Indigenous Australians nationally (45%) is more than double that of other Australians but ranges up to 82% in remote communities, causing significant health disparities. This paper examines trends in peer-reviewed research outputs related to Indigenous Australian tobacco control over the past decade and describes their research translation potential and alignment with national and jurisdictional policy priorities. Methods: Systematic searches of electronic databases were conducted: Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Systematic Reviews, PsychInfo, and Australian HealthInfoNET for English-language peer-reviewed publications (2004-2013) primarily focusing on Indigenous Australian tobacco use. Publications were categorized by types, topics, and geographic location. Following established procedures, ""reviews"" and ""commentaries"" were distinguished from ""original research,"" the latter further classified as ""measurement,"" ""descriptive,"" or ""intervention"" studies. Research translation categories used were: ""synthesis,"" ""dissemination,"" ""exchange,"" and ""application."" Results: The majority of 78 publications meeting selection criteria focused on cessation treatment (28%), monitoring and prevalence (24%) and passive smoking (13%). ""Original research"" was mostly ""descriptive/epidemiologic"" (81%) with few ""intervention"" studies (9%). Many studies were in remote communities. Components of research translation were identified in 50% of the publications with little evidence of dissemination strategies. Conclusion: Remote community populations are an area of great need. However, generally it is disappointing that since 2004, few intervention studies are available to guide efforts to reduce tobacco-related health disparities. Stronger and more immediate alignment of policy with research that contributes to the evidence-base is required together with more systematic use of research dissemination translation strategies to better match evidence with priorities which may develop rapidly over time."
A Review on Community-Based Knowledge Transfer and Exchange (KTE) Initiatives for Promoting Well-Being in Older Adults	"Knowledge transfer and exchange (KTE) processes can facilitate evidence-informed community-based care for seniors, but understanding effective KTE in gerontology is limited. A scoping review was conducted to evaluate the current state of KTE in the community-based sector for seniors. Twelve articles met the inclusion criteria, which addressed a broad variety of topics including caregiving, elder abuse, falls prevention, home-rehabilitation, hospice and dementia care. Studies evaluated KTE practices (n = 8), developed a KTE intervention (n = 3), or explored research uptake (n = 1). Community-based initiatives for seniors informed by KTE processes are scarce, requiring further efforts at the research, practice and policy levels."
A Scoping Review of Emergency Department Discharge Instructions for Children and Adolescents With Mental Disorders	"BACKGROUND: Although most young people under the age of 25 years with mental health presentations to the emergency department (ED) are discharged home, several studies suggest discharge instructions are inadequate. We conducted a scoping review to characterize and map the literature, identify research gaps, and prioritize targeted areas for future reviews for ED discharge instructions for young people with mental disorders. METHODS: Our review was conducted in an iterative approach with 6 stages including identifying the research question, identifying relevant studies, study selection, data extraction, collaring and summarizing, and stakeholder engagement. We characterized the available information on discharge instruction interventions using the Behavior Change Wheel. RESULTS: Of the 805 potential publications screened, 25 were included for extraction. Nine of the 25 articles focused on suicide or self-harm, 6 were on mental health in general or mixed groups, and 9 focused on alcohol, tobacco, or substance use in general. Five studies included younger children (ie, less than 12 years) but ages ranged significantly among studies. Education and persuasion were intervention functions most commonly reported in publications (n = 13 and n = 12, respectively). From the policy categories, recommendations regarding service provision were most frequently made from four publications. Descriptions of theory were limited in publications. CONCLUSIONS: The available literature regarding discharge instructions in the ED for youth with mental disorders is focused on certain content areas (eg, self injurious behaviors, substance use) with more work required in chronic mental disorders that make up a significant proportion of ED visits. Research that extends beyond education and with theoretical underpinnings to explain how and why various interventions work would be useful for clinicians, policy-makers, and other researchers."
A scoping review of end user involvement in disability research	"BACKGROUND: Involving clients and consumers of health care in research, policy and health service development has been widely advocated for across a number of different fields and disciplines. Despite some promising evidence, 'end users' have not been meaningfully involved in all stages of the research process in the area of disability research. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a scoping review on end user involvement in disability research, service and policy development. METHODS: Literature was searched using electronic databases, hand searching reference lists of papers and grey literature. Electronic databases searched included the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Google Scholar. The search was restricted to articles published in English between January 2000 and April 2013. RESULTS: Two clear themes emerged from a review of twenty-seven articles. Firstly, end users can benefit research as 'experts of experience' through their role as a co-researcher. Secondly, evidence suggests end users add value at different stages of the research process in this role. However, less is understood about end user involvement in the latter stages of the research process. CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that end users can meaningfully contribute to the quality of disability research. End users are likely to engage in research with differing perspectives, desires to be involved at distinct stages of the process, differing roles and different abilities to participate in the research. Academic rigor, however, must be maintained by the researcher. Copyright ¬© 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
A scoping review of evidence-based interventions available to parents of maltreated children ages 0-5 involved with child welfare services	"Parents referred to child welfare services for child maltreatment often struggle against chronic risk factors including violence, substance abuse, mental health concerns, and poverty, which impinge upon their ability to be sensitive caregivers. The first line of intervention within the child welfare context is to modify parenting behavior. This scoping review comprehensively surveyed all available literature to map the extent and range of research activity around the types of interventions available within a child welfare context to parents of infants and toddlers (0Äì5 years of age), to identify the facilitators and/or barriers to the uptake of interventions, and to check that interventions match the risk factors faced by parents. This scoping review engaged in stringent screening of studies based upon inclusion/exclusion criteria. Sixty-five articles involving forty-two interventions met inclusion criteria. Interventions generally aimed to improve parenting practices, the relationship between parent and child, and/or attachment security, along with reducing child abuse and/or neglect. A notable finding of this scoping review is that at present, interventions for parents of children ages 0Äì5 involved with the child welfare system are most frequently measured via case study and quasi-experimental designs, with randomized control trials making up 26.2% of included study designs.

A Scoping Review of Photovoice Research Among People With HIV.	"We describe how Photovoice-a participatory method in which people express and share ideas via images-has been used in research with people living with HIV (PLWH). Four databases, reference lists, and journal tables of content were searched to identify peer-reviewed original research, in English, using Photovoice with a sample of PLWH, between 1994 and 2016. Of 1,898 citations identified, 22 studies were included. Studies included a mean of 18 (range 4-38) participants. Studies were of strong quality but lacked consistent procedures. Goals varied and projects included different combinations of introductory, photo training, ethics, group, individual, and exhibit sessions. Descriptions of the researcher-participant relationship were uneven. Photovoice allowed PLWH to inform research and practice priorities through their own visual perspectives. Continued use of Photovoice with PLWH is recommended with greater emphasis on consistent methods and detailed reporting; more studies should be undertaken resulting in actions or advocacy.

A scoping review of skills and tools oral health professionals need to engage children and parents in dietary changes to prevent childhood obesity and consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages	"OBJECTIVES: Increased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) has been linked to obesity. Obesity now affects one in six children in the United States. The purpose of this scoping review is to identify and review published studies that discuss skills and tools oral health professionals can use with children (under age 12) and their parents to encourage dietary changes to aid in preventing childhood obesity and reducing consumption of SSBs. METHODS: Key search terms were identified and used to examine selected databases via PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. A total of 637 records were identified. After duplicates were removed and records were screened for eligibility, 33 remained. Six met established inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in the review. RESULTS: Only two full-text articles included dental-office-based weight interventions. Patient response to education on healthy habits and weight maintenance in the dental setting was favorable. Literature supports oral health professionals expanding their role in health care delivery by offering nutrition and physical activity recommendations to prevent and/or reduce chronic disease. Active listening and motivational interviewing were techniques identified to promote beneficial lifestyle changes. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited research on behavior modification tools and skills that have been effectively implemented in the dental setting to decrease risk of obesity. Oral health professionals are uniquely positioned to address consumption of SSBs and promote positive dietary habits for improved weight management. Future studies are needed to identify effective techniques that techniques that oral health professionals can integrate into preventive patient care.

"A scoping review of the experiences, benefits, and challenges involved in volunteer work among youth and young adults with a disability"	"PURPOSE: To develop a better understanding of the experiences of volunteer work among youth with disabilities. METHOD: A scoping review was undertaken to assess the benefits and challenges of volunteering among youth with disabilities. Comprehensive searches using six international databases were conducted. Eligible articles included: (a) youth aged 30 or younger, with a disability; (b) empirical research on the benefits or challenges of volunteering; (c) published in a peer-reviewed journal between 1980 and 2014. RESULTS: Of the 1558 articles identified, 20 articles - involving 1409 participants, aged 12-30, across five countries - met the inclusion criteria. Studies linked volunteering to the development of human capital (i.e. practical experience, improved self-determination, self-confidence, coping), enhanced social capital (i.e. social and communication skills, social inclusion) and improved cultural capital (i.e. helping others, contributing to community). Many youth with disabilities also encountered challenges - including lack of accessible volunteer opportunities, difficulties arranging transportation, and negative attitudes from potential supervisors. CONCLUSIONS: Young people with disabilities are willing and able to volunteer, and they report benefits of volunteering; however, they face many challenges in finding suitable volunteer positions. More rigorous research is needed to understand the health and social benefits of volunteering and how it can help youth develop career pathways. Implications for Rehabilitation Clinicians, educators and parents should discuss the benefits of volunteering with youth with disabilities and assist them in finding placements that match their interests and abilities. Managers and clinicians should consider incorporating volunteering into vocational rehabilitation programming (i.e. addressing how to find placements and connecting youth to organisations). Clinicians should encourage youth to take part in social and extracurricular activities to help build their social skills and networks where they can learn about volunteer opportunities. Clinicians and educators should advocate on behalf of youth with disabilities among community organisations to help break down barriers and reduce misconceptions and negative attitudes by showcasing the abilities that youth with disabilities have to offer."
A scoping review of the literature on benefits and challenges of participating in patient education programs aimed at promoting self-management for people living with chronic illness	"OBJECTIVE: To give a comprehensive overview of benefits and challenges from participating in group based patient education programs that are carried out by health care professionals and lay participants, aimed at promoting self-management for people living with chronic illness. METHODS: We searched 8 literature databases. Full text articles meeting the inclusion criteria were retrieved and reviewed. Arksey and O'Malley's framework for scoping studies guided the review process and thematic analysis was undertaken to synthesize extracted data. RESULTS: Of the 5935 titles identified, 47 articles were included in this review. The participants experienced the programs as beneficial according to less symptom distress and greater awareness of their own health, improved self-management strategies, peer support, learning and hope. CONCLUSION: A substantial evidence base supports the conclusion that group based self-management patient education programs in different ways have been experienced as beneficial, but more research is needed. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The insights gained from this review can enable researchers, health care professionals, and participants to understand the complexity in evaluating self-management patient education programs, and constitute a basis for a more standardized and systematic evaluation. The results may also encourage health care professionals in planning and carrying out programs in cooperation with lay participants. Copyright ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
A scoping review of the literature on the involvement of service users in personality disorder services.	"BACKGROUND: Service user involvement is receiving increasing support from mental health policy makers, service planners and research commissioners. However, we lack a good understanding of the nature and extent to which service users are involved in personality disorder (PD) services and the effects of involvement in these services. OBJECTIVES: To review and appraise published sources; increase understanding about service user involvement in PD services; and highlight knowledge gaps and related issues. METHODS: A scoping review methodology was adopted. Data were 'charted' to illustrate the landscape of writings and views and a qualitative analysis synthesized the results in terms of key emergent themes. RESULTS: Only a small amount of published work was identified with significant gaps in the literature. Effects were reported mostly in terms processes and emotional and practical benefits for service users. Emergent themes were wellness and health, recruitment and support for service users. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review uncovered a lack of published work despite service user involvement being a key strand of health policy. There is a need for outcomes-focused research regarding service user involvement. Successful user involvement in PD services requires attention to be focused on the context, recruitment, support and 'wellness' of service users."
"A scoping review of the literature: Content, focus, conceptualization and application of the national standards for culturally and linguistically appropriate services in health care"	"With the aim of addressing inequalities and disparities in health care access and outcomes, in 2001 the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health (OMH) established National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS). In 2010 the OMH solicited public, private and government input which was incorporated into the Enhanced National CLAS Standards. To date there have been no formal reviews of the published literature on the CLAS Standards. The aim of this scoping review was to identify the scientific and professional literature related to the CLAS standards and describe the content, focus, conceptualization and application of these publications, with the goal of providing insights and directions for further research and application of the CLAS standards.

A scoping review of the working alliance in acquired brain injury rehabilitation	"Purpose: The aim was to review the empirical literature to determine the nature and breadth of research into the working alliance in acquired brain injury (ABI) rehabilitation. Methods: A scoping review was conducted, beginning with a systematic search of relevant databases using key search terms. Studies with a focus on the role of the working alliance in shaping rehabilitation outcomes, and factors influencing perceptions of the working alliance were included and key information extracted. Results: A total of 10 quantitative studies met inclusion criteria. In most studies, ratings of the working alliance were compared with other process variables or outcome measures. The working alliance was linked to positive activity and participation outcomes, including return to work, school, and driving. Client related factors such as age, level of education and approach to rehabilitation tasks were associated with client and therapist perceptions of the working alliance. Conclusions: The working alliance emerged as a complex process that interacts with many factors and processes at play in the rehabilitation environment. Notwithstanding the limitations of the research base, findings indicate that enhancement of the working alliance may indeed influence rehabilitation outcomes. Allowing time for the development of the working alliance, and consideration of factors such as therapist skill, may support therapists to strengthen their alliances in ABI rehabilitation. Implications for Rehabilitation: Allowing time for the development of the working alliance has the potential to enhance the alliance and thereby influence rehabilitation outcomes. Factors such as the client's age and level of education may influence the strength of the working alliance, and hence, awareness of these factors may assist clinicians in maintaining strong alliances with all clients. A strong working alliance is possible in the presence of client cognitive impairment, however, the skill of the therapist may be important in managing the potential impact of cognitive impairment on the working alliance."
A scoping review of video gaming in rehabilitation	"PURPOSE: To examine the scope of the peer-reviewed literature on the use of commercially available video gaming in rehabilitation. METHODS: Five databases (SCOPUS, Cochrane, PsycINFO, PubMed and CINAHL) were searched for articles published between January 1990 and January 2014. The reference lists of selected articles were also reviewed to identify other relevant studies. RESULTS: Thirty articles met the inclusion criteria. Commercially available video gaming in rehabilitation was most commonly recommended by physiotherapists (50% or 15/30 studies) for populations at risk for falls or with decreased balance (67% or 19/30 studies). The most commonly used target outcomes were those assessing balance and/or fall prevention, with the Berg Balance Scale being the most frequently used (53% or 16/30 studies) outcome measure. The Nintendo Wii was the most prevalent gaming system (90% or 27/30 studies) used in the identified studies. CONCLUSION: Video gaming in rehabilitation is widely used by clinicians. Preliminary findings show that video gaming technology can be applied across a wide variety of rehabilitation populations, with some evidence showing clinical gains in physical functioning (e.g. gait and balance). There is a need for more robust clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of using video game systems as an adjunct to conventional rehabilitation. Implications for Rehabilitation Video gaming is a readily available technology that has been suggested as an enjoyable and motivating activity that engages patients in rehabilitation programming. Video gaming is becoming an increasingly popular adjunct to traditional therapy. Video gaming is most commonly used by physical therapists in a hospital setting for those with balance impairments. Video gaming has been shown to improve functional outcomes."
A scoping review on community mobilisation for maternal and child health in sub-Saharan Africa: Impact on empowerment.	"This review integrates evidence on community mobilisation (CM) for maternal and child health in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to identify the impact on empowerment. For the purposes of this review we use the following definition of CM: 'a capacity-building process through which community members, groups or organizations plan, carry out and evaluate activities on a participatory and sustained basis to improve their health and other conditions, either on their own initiative or stimulated by others', Howard-Grabman, L., Storti, C., Hummer, P., Pooler, B., & Geneva: USAID (2007). Demystifying community mobilization: An effective strategy to improve maternal and newborn health. Retrieved from http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnadi338.pdf, p. 5]. A scoping review was chosen to conduct a search and analysis of the literature due to the broad, complex nature of the topic. The search yielded 136 articles, and 19 met the inclusion criteria. This review illustrates CM as an important research process for engaging the community, ensuring that interventions are meeting the needs of the community, take context into account and are sustainable. Community mobilisation was associated with positive behaviour change and/or health outcomes. However, community mobilisation was not defined or operationalised consistently among the identified studies. Empowerment was also not defined, measured, or reported on in the articles. This review provides recommendations for the reporting of CM and its influence on empowerment in communities in sub-Saharan Africa."
A Scoping Review on Models of Integrative Medicine: What Is Known from the Existing Literature?	"OBJECTIVES: Integrative medicine (IM) has been recognized and introduced into Western healthcare systems over the past two decades. Limited information on IM models is available to guide development of an optimal healthcare service. A scoping review was carried out to evaluate IM models in the extant literature, including the distinctive features of each model, to gain an understanding of the core requirements needed to develop models of IM that best meet the needs of patients. DESIGN: Directed content analysis was used to classify the IM models into systems based on coding schema developed from theoretical models and to identify the key concepts of each system. RESULTS: From 1374 articles identified, 45 studies were included. Models were categorized as theoretical and practical and were subdivided into five main models: coexistence, cooptative, cooperative, collaborative, and patient-centered care. They were then divided into three systems-independent, dependent, and integrative-on the basis of the level of involvement of general practitioners and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners. The theoretical coexistence and cooptative models have distinct roles for different health care professionals, whereas practical models tend to be ad hoc market-driven services, dependent on patient demand. The cooperative and collaborative models were team-based, with formalized interaction between the two medical paradigms of conventional medicine and CAM, with the practical models focusing on facilitating communication, behaviors, and relationships. The patient-centered care model recognized the philosophy of CAM and required collaboration between disciplines based around patient needs. CONCLUSIONS: The focus of IM models has transferred from providers to patients with the independent and integrative systems. This may require a philosophical shift for IM. Further research is required to best understand how to practice patient-centered care in IM services."
A scoping review provided a framework for new ways of doing research through mobilizing collective intelligence	"OBJECTIVES: New forms of research involving collective intelligence (CI) of diverse individuals mobilized through crowdsourcing is successfully emerging in various fields. This scoping review aimed to describe these methods across different fields and propose a framework for implementation. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We searched seven electronic databases for reports describing projects that had mobilized CI with crowdsourcing. We used content analysis to develop themes and categories of the methods. RESULTS: We identified 145 reports. CI was mobilized to generate ideas, conduct evaluations, solve problems, and create intellectual outputs. Most projects (n = 110, 76%) were open to the public without restrictions on participants' expertise. Participants contributed to projects by independent contribution (i.e., no interaction with other participants) (n = 50, 34%), collaboration (n = 41, 28%), competitions (n = 33, 23%), and playing games (n = 16, 11%). In total, 61% of articles (n = 89) reported methods to evaluate participants' contribution and decision-making process: 43% used an independent panel of experts and 18% involved end users. We identified challenges in implementation and sustainability of CI and proposed solutions. CONCLUSION: New research methods based on CI through crowdsourcing could transform clinical research. This framework facilitates the implementation of these methods. Copyright ¬© 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
A scoping review to understand the effectiveness of linking schemes from healthcare providers to community resources to improve the health and well-being of people with long-term conditions	"The prevalence of people living with long-term conditions is increasing, accompanied by an increased expectation that patients will become more involved in self-management. Long-term conditions are associated with increased social isolation and poor physical and mental health. But there remains a gap in health provision between providing medical treatment and effectively addressing psychosocial well-being. One potential way of addressing this gap is by utilising social interventions which link patients from health services to community-based sources of support. However, the mechanisms involved in the delivery of interventions providing that link and their effectiveness remain unclear. This review adopted the methodological framework for conducting scoping studies, searching for both academic and grey literature on social interventions which link people from healthcare settings to a range of community and voluntary sector organisations. A literature search between May and June 2013, involving five electronic databases, hand searching of two journals and the use of Google search engine, identified seven studies relevant to the review question. In terms of key characteristics and mechanisms of the interventions, mental health conditions and social isolation were the most common reasons for referral to the interventions, and referrals were usually made through general practices. Almost all the interventions were facilitator-led, whereby the facilitator worked to identify and link participants to appropriate community-based resources. In regard to health and social outcomes and their cost-effectiveness, studies reported improvement to participants' psychological and social well-being as well as their decreased use of health services, although there were limited measures of participants' physical health outcomes. Interventions for linking patients from healthcare setting to community-based resources target and address psychosocial needs of participants. The review identified involvement of health professionals in aiding the referral of patients to the intervention and the role of the intervention facilitators as key components of the interventions.

A Scoping Review: Social Participation as a Cornerstone of Successful Aging in Place among Rural Older Adults	"Despite obstacles, many rural-dwelling older adults report that positive aspects of rural residence, such as attachment to community, social participation, and familiarity, create a sense of belonging that far outweighs the negative. By being part of a community where they are known and they know people, rural elders continue to find meaning, the key to achieving successful aging in this last stage of life. This scoping review explored factors influencing social participation and, through it, successful aging among rural-dwelling older adults. We sought to answer the question: what factors enhance or detract from the ability of rural-dwelling older adults to engage in social participation in rural communities? The scoping review resulted in 19 articles that highlight the importance of supports to enable older people to spend time with others, including their pets, engage in volunteer and community activities, and help maintain their home and care for their pets. Overall, the lack of services, including local health care facilities, was less important than the attachment to place and social capital associated with aging in place."
A scoping study of indigenous child welfare: The long emergency and preparations for the next seven generations	"This scoping study yielded 37 empirical studies published in peer-reviewed journals addressing one of the most pressing, sensitive, and controversial issues facing child welfare policymakers and practitioners today: the dramatic overrepresentation of Indigenous families in North American public child welfare systems. These studies indicate that relative to other child welfare-involved families, Indigenous families typically experience intense social challenges in the face of few available services. They also may experience racism when accessing available county, state and provincial child welfare services that undermines trust and engagement. Some promising research suggests that partnerships between government child welfare systems and Indigenous tribes and communities may improve services to struggling families. Given the seriousness of the social justice issues, as well as the sheer volume of empirical research in child welfare, the question of how to strengthen child welfare with Indigenous families clearly is under-researched. Notable gaps in the existing literature include the voices of Indigenous children and parents involved in the child welfare system and attention to cultural variation in child protection beliefs and practices across the many Indigenous communities of North America. More work also is needed to design, implement, and evaluate culturally-based child welfare practices; and examine how to build capacity at the tribal level.

A Synthesis Of Knowledge About Caregiver Decision Making Finds Gaps In Support For Those Who Care For Aging Loved Ones	"We conducted a mixed-methods knowledge synthesis to assess the effectiveness of interventions to improve caregivers' involvement in decision making with seniors, and to describe caregivers' experiences of decision making in the absence of interventions. We analyzed forty-nine qualitative, fourteen quantitative, and three mixed-methods studies. The qualitative studies indicated that caregivers had unmet needs for information, discussions of values and needs, and decision support, which led to negative sentiments after decision making. Our results indicate that there have been insufficient quantitative evaluations of interventions to involve caregivers in decision making with seniors and that the evaluations that do exist found few clinically significant effects. Elements of usual care that received positive evaluations were the availability of a decision coach and a supportive decision-making environment. Additional rigorously evaluated interventions are needed to help caregivers be more involved in decision making with seniors."
A systematic critical appraisal for non-pharmacological management of osteoarthritis using the appraisal of guidelines research and evaluation II instrument	"Clinical practice CPGs (CPGs) have been developed to summarize evidence related to the management of osteoarthritis (OA). CPGs facilitate uptake of evidence-based knowledge by consumers, health professionals, health administrators and policy makers. The objectives of the present review were: 1) to assess the quality of the CPGs on non-pharmacological management of OA; using a standardized and validated instrument--the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) tool--by three pairs of trained appraisers; and 2) to summarize the recommendations based on only high-quality existing CPGs. Scientific literature databases from 2001 to 2013 were systematically searched for the state of evidence, with 17 CPGs for OA being identified. Most CPGs effectively addressed only a minority of AGREE II domains. Scope and purpose was effectively addressed in 10 CPGs on the management of OA, stakeholder involvement in 12 CPGs, rigour of development in 10 CPGs, clarity/presentation in 17 CPGs, editorial independence in 2 CPGs, and applicability in none of the OA CPGs. The overall quality of the included CPGs, according to the 7-point AGREE II scoring system, is 4.8 +/- 0.41 for OA. Therapeutic exercises, patient education, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, acupuncture, orthoses and insoles, heat and cryotherapy, patellar tapping, and weight control are commonly recommended for the non-pharmacological management of OA by the high-quality CPGs. The general clinical management recommendations tended to be similar among high-quality CPGs, although interventions addressed varied. Non-pharmacological management interventions were superficially addressed in more than half of the selected CPGs. For CPGs to be standardized uniform creators should use the AGREE II criteria when developing CPGs. Innovative and effective methods of CPG implementation to users are needed to ultimately enhance the quality of life of arthritic individuals."
A systematic critical review of physical activity aspects in clinical guidelines for multiple sclerosis	"OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to evaluate the quality of clinical guidelines (CGs) for MS and to critically appraise physical activity-related recommendations. DATA SOURCES: Medical databases (MEDLINE, TRIP), clearinghouses, and guideline developers. An expert was asked to confirm if the list of CGs was complete. STUDY SELECTION: Evidence-based CGs specific to MS with recommendations including aspects of rehabilitation or physical activity were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently first assessed the methodological quality of the CGs based on the 23 items of the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument version two (AGREE II) and second evaluated the physical activity-related content quality using an instrument containing 14 items that was used for the development of the National Recommendations for Physical Activity in Germany. DATA SYNTHESIS: For the AGREE II domains and the criteria for content quality, standardized domain scores were calculated. RESULTS: Three CGs were included. The average scores for the methodological quality of the domains were: scope and purpose (91%), stakeholder involvement (81%), rigor of development (78%), clarity of presentation (93%), applicability (53%), and editorial independence (83%). The mean scores for physical activity-related content quality did not exceed 56% for any criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this critical review shows that the methodological quality of CGs were moderate to good but physical activity-related content quality was heterogeneous and low. Results emphasize the need for more specific physical activity recommendations that incorporate multiple aspects of physical activity prescription. Copyright ¬© 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V."
A systematic literature review of evidence-based clinical practice for rare diseases: what are the perceived and real barriers for improving the evidence and how can they be overcome?	"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based clinical practice is challenging in all fields, but poses special barriers in the field of rare diseases. The present paper summarises the main barriers faced by clinical research in rare diseases, and highlights opportunities for improvement. METHODS: Systematic literature searches without meta-analyses and internal European Clinical Research Infrastructure Network (ECRIN) communications during face-to-face meetings and telephone conferences from 2013 to 2017 within the context of the ECRIN Integrating Activity (ECRIN-IA) project. RESULTS: Barriers specific to rare diseases comprise the difficulty to recruit participants because of rarity, scattering of patients, limited knowledge on natural history of diseases, difficulties to achieve accurate diagnosis and identify patients in health information systems, and difficulties choosing clinically relevant outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based clinical practice for rare diseases should start by collecting clinical data in databases and registries; defining measurable patient-centred outcomes; and selecting appropriate study designs adapted to small study populations. Rare diseases constitute one of the most paradigmatic fields in which multi-stakeholder engagement, especially from patients, is needed for success. Clinical research infrastructures and expertise networks offer opportunities for establishing evidence-based clinical practice within rare diseases."
A Systematic Literature Review of Technologies for Suicidal Behavior Prevention	"Suicide is the second cause of death in young people. The use of technologies as tools facilitates the detection of individuals at risk of suicide thus allowing early intervention and efficacy. Suicide can be prevented in many cases. Technology can help people at risk of suicide and their families. It could prevent situations of risk of suicide with the technological evolution that is increasing. This work is a systematic review of research papers published in the last ten years on technology for suicide prevention. In September 2017, the consultation was carried out in the scientific databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library and Google Scholar. A general search was conducted with the terms ÄúpreventionÄù AND ÄúsuicideÄù AND ""technology. More specific searches included technologies such as ""WebÄù, ÄúmobileÄù, Äúsocial networksÄù, and others terms related to technologies. The number of articles found following the methodology proposed was 90, but only 30 are focused on the objective of this work. Most of them were Web technologies (51.61%), mobile solutions (22.58%), social networks (12.90%), machine learning (3.23%) and other technologies (9.68%). According to the results obtained, although there are technological solutions that help the prevention of suicide, much remains to be done in this field. Collaboration among technologists, psychiatrists, patients, and family members is key to advancing the development of new technology-based solutions that can help save lives."
A systematic literature review of the application of information communication technology for visually impaired people	"Technological advancement in general is providing better and cheaper solutions to assist the visually impaired (VI) community. Although information communication technology (ICT) has great potential to support the inclusion of VI people in educational, social and workforce settings, there are far fewer ICT projects for VI people compared to other projects. This systematic literature review provides our findings on the existing state of ICT projects and describes outstanding issues in ICT support of VI people. Based on our findings, we suggest increased collaboration among healthcare professionals, caregivers, programmers, engineers, as well as policy makers; and adoption of policies in future ICT projects for VI people. A wide search of seven journal databases found a relevant cross-section of articles that were published between 2010 and 2015. Software Zotero Standalone and EndNote were used to screen and maintain metadata. After the initial screening of 6993 titles, 683 abstracts were scrutinised, from which 55 full text articles were selected for final review. We analysed and synthesised 37 articles. Our findings show the progress, awareness, interest, and issues in ICT integration to improve the quality of life for VI people. Three emergent topics for VI people are (a) assistive technology, (b) e-accessibility, and (c) virtual interfaces. Our findings suggest that ICT-aided applications can bring positive changes for VI people. We advance several issues that should be addressed and further developed, collaboratively, to spread awareness and invoke new policies aimed to improve the quality of life of VI people.

A systematic literature review of trials of survivorship interventions for women with gynaecological cancer and their caregivers	"Core components of survivorship care include treatment of late and long-term effects, care coordination, promotion of psychological well-being, health and addressing special populations' needs. Women affected by gynaecological cancer and their caregivers can experience disease-specific issues. This review presents an overview of survivorship interventions that have been trialled among this population. Databases were searched in October/November 2016 to identify eligible studies. Titles, abstracts then full-text were assessed for inclusion by two reviewers until consensus was reached. Data were abstracted using standard tables. Study quality was independently appraised. Twenty-eight articles were included (five reviews; 23 trials). In regards to late and long-term treatment effects, our review found mounting high-level evidence for the effectiveness of psycho-educational programmes to improve physical aspects of sexual function and for exercise interventions for reducing fatigue. We also found emerging evidence for nurse-led follow-up care to improve care coordination and cognitive behavioural therapy to improve psychological wellbeing. There were gaps in the evidence for interventions to effectively address psychosexual issues specific to gynaecological cancer and needs of caregivers. Further research is required to explore strategies to improving psychosexual concerns after gynaecological cancer and the dynamics and supportive care needs of the patient-partner dyad.

A systematic mixed studies review on Organizational Participatory Research: towards operational guidance.	"BACKGROUND: Organizational Participatory Research (OPR) seeks organizational learning and/or practice improvement. Previous systematic literature reviews described some OPR processes and outcomes, but the link between these processes and outcomes is unknown. We sought to identify and sequence the key processes of OPR taking place with and within healthcare organizations and the main outcomes to which they contribute, and to define ideal-types of OPR. METHODS: This article reports a participatory systematic mixed studies review with qualitative synthesis A specialized health librarian searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase Classic + Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, Social Work Abstracts and Business Source Complete, together with grey literature data bases were searched from inception to November 29, 2012. This search was updated using forward citation tracking up to June 2014. Reporting quality was appraised and unclear articles were excluded. Included studies clearly reported OPR where the main research related decisions were co-constructed among the academic and healthcare organization partners. Included studies were distilled into summaries of their OPR processes and outcomes, which were subsequently analysed using deductive and inductive thematic analysis. All summaries were analysed; that is, data analysis continued beyond saturation. RESULTS: Eighty-three studies were included from the 8873 records retrieved. Eight key OPR processes were identified. Four follow the phases of research: 1) form a work group and hold meetings, 2) collectively determine research objectives, 3) collectively analyse data, and 4) collectively interpret results and decide how to use them. Four are present throughout OPR: 1) communication, 2) relationships; 3) commitment; 4) collective reflection. These processes contribute to extra benefits at the individual and organizational levels. Four ideal-types of OPR were defined. Basic OPR consists of OPR processes leading to achieving the study objectives. This ideal-type and may be combined with any of the following three ideal-types: OPR resulting in random additional benefits for the individuals or organization involved, OPR spreading to other sectors of the organization and beyond, or OPR leading to subsequent initiatives. These results are illustrated with a novel conceptual model. CONCLUSION: The model provides operational guidance to help OPR stakeholders collaboratively address organizational issues and achieve desired outcomes and more. REVIEW REGISTRATION: As per PROSPERO inclusion criteria, this review is not registered."
A systematic narrative review of consumer-directed care for older people: implications for model development	"Consumer-directed care is increasingly becoming a mainstream option in community-based aged care. However, a systematic review describing how the current evaluation research translates into practise has not been published to date. This review aimed to systematically establish an evidence base of user preferences for and satisfaction with services associated with consumer-directed care programmes for older people. Twelve databases were searched, including MedLine, BioMed Central, Cinahl, Expanded Academic ASAP, PsychInfo, ProQuest, Age Line, Science Direct, Social Citation Index, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. Google Scholar and Google were also searched. Eligible studies were those reporting on choice, user preferences and service satisfaction outcomes regarding a programme or model of home-based care in the United States or United Kingdom. This systematic narrative review retrieved literature published from January 1992 to August 2011. A total of 277 references were identified. Of these 17 met the selection criteria and were reviewed. Findings indicate that older people report varying preferences for consumer-directed care with some demonstrating limited interest. Clients and carers reported good service satisfaction. However, research comparing user preferences across countries or investigating how ecological factors shape user preferences has received limited attention. Policy-makers and practitioners need to carefully consider the diverse contexts, needs and preferences of older adults in adopting consumer-directed care approaches in community aged care. The review calls for the development of consumer-directed care programmes offering a broad range of options that allow for personalisation and greater control over services without necessarily transferring the responsibility for administrative responsibilities to service users. Review findings suggest that consumer-directed care approaches have the potential to empower older people. Copyright ¬© 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Comparing Carer Focused and Dyadic Multicomponent Interventions for Carers of People With Dementia.	"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of two approaches: multicomponent interventions that focus on working with the carer and dyadic interventions that work with both the carer and the person with dementia. METHOD: A systematic review involving a search of Medline, EMBASE, and PsycINFO in October 2015 was performed. Randomized controlled trials involving carers of people with dementia and comparing multicomponent interventions with usual care were included. RESULTS: Pooling of all studies demonstrated that multicomponent interventions can reduce depressive symptoms, improve quality of life, reduce carer impact, and reduce behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia as well as caregiver upset with these symptoms. We were unable to find a significant difference in the effects of dyadic interventions in comparison with carer focused interventions for these outcomes. DISCUSSION: Although effect sizes associated with intervention are small, multicomponent interventions are relatively inexpensive to deliver, acceptable, and widely applicable."
A systematic review and meta-analysis of acceptance and commitment therapy on mental health and quality of life of women with breast cancer.	"Background and purpose: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Iranian women. Two main psychological complaints in cancer patients are depression and anxiety which have negative impacts on their quality of life. Acceptance and commitment therapy provides the involved patients with the skills to respond to these uncontrollable experiences and commitment to personal values. The purpose of this study was to review the clinical trials conducted on the effect of this method on depression, anxiety, and quality of life of these patients in Iran."
A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of educating parents on the benefits and schedules of childhood vaccinations in low and middle-income countries.	"Public health benefits of childhood vaccinations risk being derailed by low vaccination coverage in low and middle-income countries. One reason for the low coverage is poor parental knowledge of the importance of completing vaccination schedules. We therefore assessed the effects on childhood vaccination coverage, of educating parents and other persons assuming the parental role. We prospectively registered the systematic review, published the protocol, and used standard Cochrane methods to collect and synthesise the evidence. We found six eligible randomised trials with 4248 participants. Three trials assessed health-facility based education of mothers on the importance of completing vaccination schedules; immediately after birth and three months later (one study) or during the first vaccination visit (two studies). The other trials assessed community-based education, including information campaigns on the importance of vaccines using audiotaped presentations and leaflet distributions (one study); structured group discussions on benefits and costs of childhood vaccination and local action plans for improving vaccine uptake (one study); and home-based information sessions using graphic cards showing benefits and costs of childhood vaccinations and location of vaccination centres (one study). Combining the data shows that these interventions lead to substantial improvements in childhood vaccination coverage (relative increase 36%, 95% confidence interval 14% to 62%). There was no difference between the effects of community-based and facility-based education. Therefore, education in communities and health facilities on the importance of childhood vaccinations should be integrated into all vaccination programmes in low and middle-income countries; accompanied by robust monitoring of impacts and use of data for action."
A systematic review and meta-analysis of whole of community interventions to prevent excessive population weight gain	"Population-based, 'whole of community' interventions utilise community engagement processes and implement multiple strategies to improve the health of populations defined by geographical boundaries (i.e. cities, villages or regions). The aim of the review was to systematically assess the current state of knowledge about the effectiveness of population-based whole of community interventions in preventing excessive population weight gain. Systematic searches of electronic databases (1990-2011) and reference lists of included trials and previous reviews were conducted to identify interventions to prevent excessive weight gain. Population-based, whole of community interventions were defined as those targeting the weight status of a population characterised along geographical boundaries. The review included eight trials. All of the identified trials targeted children or adolescents. Seven trials reported a significant effect favouring the intervention on at least one measure of adiposity. Meta-analysis of six trials revealed a small reduction in BMI z-score among participants in intervention communities (mean difference (MD) -0.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.16 to -0.02). The review suggests that population-based, whole of community interventions can be effective in achieving modest reductions in population weight gain among children. Copyright ¬© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A systematic review and synthesis of the quantitative and qualitative evidence behind patient-centred goal setting in stroke rehabilitation	"OBJECTIVE: To map out from the literature the nature, extent and effects of application of patient-centred goal setting in stroke rehabilitation practice. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: A search was conducted in the Cochrane (Wiley), AMED, Medline (EBSCO), Embase, Sports discuss, Medline (Ovid) and CINAHL databases. Secondary search based on references from the preliminary search was undertaken. REVIEW METHODS: Quantitative and qualitative studies that included aspects of patient-centredness and goal setting in stroke patients from 1980 to June 2010 were collected. Studies were scrutinized for relevance and quality based on published methodology. The findings were synthesized by aggregating the themes from the qualitative studies and relating them to relevant findings from the quantitative studies. RESULTS: Eighteen qualitative and eight quantitative and one mixed method study conducted in stroke rehabilitation services ranging from acute to community rehabilitation were included. Themes that emerged were related to perceptions of patients and professionals regarding patient-centredness, nominal adoption of this concept, consequences of discrepancies in the perceptions and practice, related ethical conflicts, challenges to application and strategies to improve its application. The effects of following patient-centred goal-setting practice have been studied mostly with weak methodologies and studies show some benefit with psychological outcomes. CONCLUSION: Patient-centred goal setting is minimally adopted in goal-setting practice due to various barriers. Since the effects of incorporating this concept have not been evaluated rigorously it is suggested that further research is essential to investigate its effect on patient outcomes."
A systematic review and synthesis of theories of change of school-based interventions integrating health and academic education as a novel means of preventing violence and substance use among students.	"BACKGROUND: Schools can play an important role in promoting health. However, many education policies and institutions are increasingly emphasising academic attainment targets, which appear to be diminishing the time available for health education lessons. Interventions that integrate both health and academic learning may present an ideal solution, simultaneously addressing health education and academic development. The theories of change underlying these interventions are therefore of interest, but are poorly studied. METHODS: A systematic review of evaluations of interventions that integrate academic and health education for reduced substance use and/or violence was carried out. As part of this, reports describing theory were assessed for quality and data extracted. Theoretical data were synthesised within and across individual interventions using reciprocal translation and meta-ethnographic line of argument synthesis to produce an overall theory of change for interventions that integrate health and academic education to prevent substance use and violence. RESULTS: Forty-eight reports provided theoretical descriptions of 18 interventions. An overarching theory that emerged was that eroding 'boundaries' at multiple and mutually reinforcing levels-by integrating academic and health education, by transforming relationships between teachers and students, by generalising learning from classrooms to the wider school environment and by ensuring consistent messages from schools and families-is intended to lead to the development of a community of engaged students oriented towards pro-social behaviour and away from substance use, violence and other risk behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Eroding 'boundaries' between health and academic education, teachers and students, classrooms and the wider school and schools and families were seen to be the most critical to establishing new frameworks of family, classroom or school organisation that are conducive to promoting both academic and social-emotional outcomes. Whether such interventions are feasible to implement and effective in reducing risk behaviours will be examined in other reports arising from the review."
A systematic review and thematic synthesis of quality of life in the informal carers of cancer patients with cachexia	"Background: Informal carers of cancer patients with cachexia face additional challenges to those encountered by informal carers in general because of the central role food and eating play in everyday life. Patient weight loss and anorexia, core features of cancer cachexia, are frequent causes of distress in caregivers. Identification of quality of life issues can inform the development of interventions for both caregivers and patients and facilitate communication with healthcare professionals. Aim: To identify quality of life issues that are relevant to carers of cancer patients with cachexia. Design: A systematic review and thematic synthesis of the qualitative literature were conducted. Reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Data sources: PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and PsycARTICLES were searched for publications dated from January 1980 to February 2015 using search terms relating to cancer, cachexia, quality of life and carers. Papers written in the English language, featuring direct quotes from the carers of adult patients with any cancer diagnosis and cachexia or problems with weight loss or anorexia, were included. Results: Five themes were extracted from the 16 identified studies. These highlighted the impact on everyday life, the attempts of some carers to take charge, the need for healthcare professional""s input, conflict with the patient and negative emotions. Conclusion: The complexity of caring for a cancer patient with cachexia translates into a range of problems and experiences for informal carers. By addressing the impact of caring for a patient with cancer cachexia on carers, both caregiver and patient quality of life may improve. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
A systematic review of approaches for engaging patients for research on rare diseases	"BACKGROUND: Patients with rare diseases have limited access to useful information to guide treatment decisions. Engagement of patients and other stakeholders in clinical research may help to ensure that research efforts in rare diseases address relevant clinical questions and patient-centered health outcomes. Rare disease organizations may provide an effective means to facilitate patient engagement in research. However, the effectiveness of patient-engagement approaches, particularly for the study of rare diseases, has not been well studied. OBJECTIVES: To synthesize evidence about engagement of patients and other stakeholders in research on rare diseases, including the role of rare disease organizations in facilitating patient-centered research. METHODS/RESEARCH DESIGN: A systematic review and gray literature search were guided by a technical expert panel composed of patient representatives, clinicians, and researchers. English-language studies that engaged patients or other stakeholders in research on rare diseases or evaluated engagement were included. Studies were assessed on how well key research questions were answered, based on the level of detail describing engagement activities and whether outcomes from engagement were assessed. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies were included, although many reported minimal information on engagement. Patients and other stakeholders were most commonly engaged to identify patient-centered research agendas, to select which study outcomes were important to patients, to provide input on study design, and to identify strategies for increasing enrollment in trials. Rare disease organizations mainly helped provide access to patients and communicated research opportunities and findings. They also helped promote collaborative networks and provided financial support for research infrastructures. Although authors reported benefits of engagement and identified changes to their research processes, no empirical assessments of engagement practices and their effectiveness were found. CONCLUSIONS: Researchers studying rare diseases can obtain patient input regarding which research questions and health outcomes to study; however, the most effective approaches to engagement have not been well defined."
A Systematic Review of Barriers and Facilitators to Mammography in American Indian/Alaska Native Women.	"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize the current knowledge of factors that enable or impede American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) women from accessing breast cancer screening. METHODOLOGY: A systematic search of MEDLINE and CINAHL databases identified relevant research studies published from 2007 to 2017. RESULTS: Consistent with other low-income populations, socioeconomic factors were related to lower rates of screening in AI/AN women. However, some factors, such as reliance on the Indian Health Service, cultural issues, and traditionality were unique to this population. DISCUSSION: AI/AN women appear to face many of the difficulties that other low-income minority women face in accessing preventive care; however, they may face unique challenges and circumstances in accessing care. Efforts to work with tribes in the development of interventions framed by community-based participatory research are needed to tackle the disparities in the AI/AN community."
"A systematic review of barriers and facilitators to minority research participation among African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders"	"To assess the experienced or perceived barriers and facilitators to health research participation for major US racial/ethnic minority populations, we conducted a systematic review of qualitative and quantitative studies from a search on PubMed and Web of Science from January 2000 to December 2011. With 44 articles included in the review, we found distinct and shared barriers and facilitators. Despite different expressions of mistrust, all groups represented in these studies were willing to participate for altruistic reasons embedded in cultural and community priorities. Greater comparative understanding of barriers and facilitators to racial/ethnic minorities' research participation can improve population-specific recruitment and retention strategies and could better inform future large-scale prospective quantitative and in-depth ethnographic studies."
"A systematic review of barriers and facilitators to participation in randomized controlled trials by Indigenous people from New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States"	"ISSUE: Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are conducted each year but only a small proportion is specifically designed for Indigenous people. In this review we consider the challenges of participation in RCTs for Indigenous peoples from New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States and the opportunities for increasing participation. APPROACH: The literature was systematically searched for published articles including information on the barriers and facilitators for Indigenous people's participation in health-related RCTs. Articles were identified using a key word search of electronic databases (Scopus, Medline and EMBASE). To be included, papers had to include in their published work at least one aspect of their RCT that was either a barrier and/or facilitator for participation identified from, for example, design of intervention, or discussion sections of articles. Articles that were reviews, discussions, opinion pieces or rationale/methodology were excluded. Results were analysed inductively, allowing themes to emerge from the data. KEY FINDINGS: Facilitators enabling Indigenous people's participation in RCTs included relationship and partnership building, employing Indigenous staff, drawing on Indigenous knowledge models, targeted recruitment techniques and adapting study material. Challenges for participation included both participant-level factors (such as a distrust of research) and RCT-level factors (including inadequately addressing likely participant barriers (phone availability, travel costs), and a lack of recognition or incorporation of Indigenous knowledge systems. IMPLICATION: The findings from our review add to the body of knowledge on elimination of health disparities, by identifying effective and practical strategies for conducting and engaging Indigenous peoples with RCTs. Future trials that seek to benefit Indigenous peoples should actively involve Indigenous research partners, and respect and draw on pertinent Indigenous knowledge and values. This review has the potential to assist in the design of such studies. Copyright ¬© The Author(s) 2014."
"A systematic review of behavioral interventions to prevent HIV infection and transmission among heterosexual, adult men in low-and middle-income countries"	"Prevention of new HIV infections needs to move to the forefront in the fight against HIV and AIDS. In the current economic crisis, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) should invest limited resources to amass reliable evidence-based information about behavioral prevention efforts, and on behaviors that are driving the epidemic among people who are engaging in those behaviors. This paper aims to provide a systematic review and synthesis of behavioral interventions among a group of people in high HIV-burden countries: heterosexual men in LMICs. The review includes articles published between January 2001 and May 2010 that evaluated behavioral prevention interventions among heterosexual males aged 18+ years in LMICs. The studies were evaluated using the quality assessment tool for quantitative studies developed by the Effective Public Health Practice Project. The review identified 19 articles that met the review's inclusion criteria. Most studies were conducted in South Africa (n=6); two each in Uganda and Thailand; and one in each of Angola, Brazil, Bulgaria, India, Nigeria, the Philippines, Russia, Ukraine and Zimbabwe. Eight of 19 interventions increased condom use among their respective populations. Those interventions that sought to reduce the number of sexual partners had little effect, and those that addressed alcohol consumption and intimate partner violence had mixed effects. There was no evidence for any specific format of intervention that impacted best on any of the targeted risk behaviors. The paucity of evaluated interventions for heterosexual men in LMICs suggests that adult men in these countries remain underrepresented in HIV prevention efforts."
A systematic review of cancer caregiver interventions: Appraising the potential for implementation of evidence into practice	"OBJECTIVE: nformal caregivers provide substantial support for people living with cancer. Previous systematic reviews report on the efficacy of cancer caregiver interventions but not their potential to be implemented. The aim of this systematic review was to explore the potential for cancer caregiver interventions to be implemented into practice. METHODS: We searched three electronic databases to identify cancer caregiver interventions on 5 January 2018. We operationalised six implementation outcomes (acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, and costs) into a tool to guide data extraction. RESULTS: The search yielded 33 papers (27 papers from electronic databases and six papers from other sources) reporting on 26 studies that met review criteria. Fewer than half the studies (46%) contained evidence about the acceptability of interventions from caregivers' perspectives; only two studies (8%) included interventions developed with input from caregivers. Two studies (8%) addressed potential adoption of interventions, and no studies discussed intentions, agreement, or action to implement interventions into practice. All studies reported on intervention appropriateness by providing a rationale for the interventions. For feasibility, on average less than one-third of caregivers who were eligible to be involved consented to participate. On fidelity, whether interventions were conducted as intended was reported in 62% of studies. Cost data were reported in terms of intervention delivery, requiring a median time commitment of staff of 180 minutes to be delivered. CONCLUSIONS: Caregiver intervention studies lack components of study design and reporting that could bridge the gap between research and practice. There is enormous potential for improvements in cancer caregiver intervention study design to plan for future implementation. Copyright ¬© 2019 The Authors.

A systematic review of children's dietary interventions with parents as change agents: Application of the RE-AIM framework	"INTRODUCTION: Interventions targeting children's dietary behavior often include strategies that target parents as implementation agents of change, though parent involvement on intervention effectiveness is unclear. The present study systematically assessed (1) reporting of reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance (RE-AIM) of child dietary intervention studies with parents as change agents and (2) evaluated within these studies the comparative effectiveness of interventions with and without a parent component. METHODS: The search was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library. Eligible studies were required to include a condition with a parental component, a comparison/control group, and target a child dietary behavior outcome. Forty-nine articles met criteria. Raters extracted RE-AIM and parent implementation information for each study. RESULTS: Effectiveness (72.5%) was the highest reported RE-AIM element, followed by reach (27.5%), adoption (12.5%), implementation (10%), and maintenance (2.5%). Median reporting of parent implementation was highest for adoption and enactment (20%), followed by receipt (7.5%), and maintenance (2.5%). Six studies tested comparative effectiveness of parental involvement on child dietary outcomes. CONCLUSION: Current RE-AIM reporting among children's dietary interventions is inchoate. The contribution of parental involvement on intervention effectiveness remains unclear. Increased focus should be placed on reporting of external validity information, to enable better translation of research to practical applications. Copyright ¬© 2016. Published by Elsevier Inc."
A systematic review of community interventions to improve Aboriginal child passenger safety	"We evaluated evidence of community interventions to improve Aboriginal child passenger safety (CPS) in terms of its scientific merit and cultural relevance. We included studies if they reported interventions to improve CPS in Aboriginal communities, compared at least pre- and postintervention conditions, and evaluated rates and severity of child passenger injuries, child restraint use, or knowledge of CPS. We also appraised quality and cultural relevance of studies. Study quality was associated with community participation and cultural relevance. Strong evidence showed that multicomponent interventions tailored to each community improves CPS. Interventions in Aboriginal communities should incorporate Aboriginal views of health, involve the community, and be multicomponent and tailored to the community's circumstances and culture."
A systematic review of community-based participatory research to enhance clinical trials in racial and ethnic minority groups	"OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of current community-based participatory research (CBPR) clinical trials involving racial and ethnic minorities. DATA SOURCE: All published peer-reviewed CBPR intervention articles in PubMed and CINAHL databases from January 2003 to May 2010. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a systematic literature review. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Data were extracted on each study's characteristics, community involvement in research, subject recruitment and retention, and intervention effects. PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: We found 19 articles meeting inclusion criteria. Of these, 14 were published from 2007 to 2010. Articles described some measures of community participation in research with great variability. Although CBPR trials examined a wide range of behavioral and clinical outcomes, such trials had very high success rates in recruiting and retaining minority participants and achieving significant intervention effects. CONCLUSIONS: Significant publication gaps remain between CBPR and other interventional research methods. CBPR may be effective in increasing participation of racial and ethnic minority subjects in research and may be a powerful tool in testing the generalizability of effective interventions among these populations. CBPR holds promise as an approach that may contribute greatly to the study of health care delivery to disadvantaged populations. Copyright ¬© Health Research and Educational Trust."
A systematic review of community-based research interventions for domestic violence survivors	"Objectives: Community-based research is a broad approach in which researchers work closely with practitioners and community members to enhance the understanding of a given phenomenon and promote positive outcomes. In the domestic violence (DV) field, community-based research is a particularly useful strategy to develop and evaluate interventions that address unique community needs. Despite the potential benefits of this approach, to our knowledge, no systematic review has synthesized DV-focused interventions and evaluations designed using a community-based research approach. This study aimed to fill that gap. Method: Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of the literature, retrieving articles that described the collaborative development and evaluation of interventions for DV survivors residing in the United States. Articles were identified from peer-reviewed databases, bibliographies, and experts. Twenty of the 199 articles assessed for eligibility were included. Results: Interventions primarily consisted of small-group sessions focusing on survivors"" mental health and safety needs. Evaluations focused on process metrics, although approximately half reported changes in survivors"" outcomes. Collaboration generally occurred between DV advocates and applied health care academic teams. Authors described the promotion of collaboration in multiple ways and to varying degrees. Common examples included shared decision-making, recognizing and addressing potential power imbalances, longitudinal relationship building, changing programs based on stakeholder feedback, and co-owned project outputs including coauthorship of manuscripts. Conclusions: This is the first systematic review of interventions to support DV survivors, developed using a community-based research approach. Implications include promoting community-based outcome evaluations and developing guidelines for teams publishing community-based research in the peer-reviewed literature.

A systematic review of components of community-based organisation engagement.	"Community-based organisations (CBOs) are important for eliminating health disparities globally and translating research findings to inform interventions. Engagement is an integral part of partnerships between CBOs and community health researchers and impacts the quality and quantity of any desired outcome. Despite the acknowledged benefits of community-based organisation engagement (CBOE), there are variations in its operationalisation and paucity in the understanding of its use in community-scientific partnerships. To further understand CBOE, the aim of this study was to synthesise published literature relevant to the definitions and applications of CBOE and identify its key components. A systematic search was conducted in March 2017, and updated in June 2017. Keywords were varied to account for international differences in spelling and word usage. Five major databases, MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Google Scholar, were used to identify potential research studies. A total of 32 studies were included in this review. Following the analysis of the literature, four salient themes emerged as components of CBOE: (1) Need (a consensus between all the parties in a partnership on the importance of a specified project and its proposed benefits to a target community); (2) Partnership Dynamics (the workings of a relationship between a CBO and a scientific/academic stakeholder); (3) Resources (include but are not limited to: personnel, money, work space, expertise and equipment); and (4) Outcomes (products of the partnership). This review provides a foundation for future research in applying CBOE to translational research and interventions. This analysis will assist community health researchers in planning partnerships with CBOs, and make necessary adjustments to improve study outcomes. Appropriate application of the components of CBOE in partnerships will assist researchers in addressing health disparities. Copyright ¬© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"A systematic review of consumer-providers"" effects on client outcomes in statutory mental health services: The evidence and the path beyond"	"Consumer-provider involvement in the delivery of mental health services has steadily increased in the past several decades; however, the effects on client and service outcomes have remained unclear. The objectives of this paper are to (a) summarize a Cochrane review of consumer-providers"" effects on client outcomes in statutory mental health services and (b) discuss several key issues that, if addressed, might strengthen evidence in this area. We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Current Contents until March 2012 to identify relevant studies. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they randomized adult clients to statutory mental health services delivered with and without consumer-provider involvement. Eleven studies met the eligibility criteria and were divided into 2 separate comparison groups: studies comparing consumer-providers with professionals employed in the same role within a mental health service (5 studies) and studies comparing mental health services with and without consumer-providers as an adjunct to the service (6 studies). The limited outcome data available from the studies indicated no difference in quality of life, function, social relations, mental health symptoms, client satisfaction, or attrition in those receiving services from consumer-providers compared with those who did not. None of the studies reported any adverse outcomes for clients. Addressing several key issues could strengthen the evidence such as: core outcome measures, appropriate study designs for evaluating complex interventions, minimal cross-contamination of treatment groups for community- based interventions, improved trial reporting, and the use of systematic reviews to inform future research.

A Systematic Review of Digital Interventions for Improving the Diet and Physical Activity Behaviors of Adolescents	"Many adolescents have poor diet and physical activity behaviors, which can lead to the development of noncommunicable diseases in later life. Digital platforms offer inexpensive means of delivering health interventions, but little is known about their effectiveness. This systematic review was conducted to synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of digital interventions to improve diet quality and increase physical activity in adolescents, to effective intervention components and to assess the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. Following a systematic search, abstracts were assessed against inclusion criteria, and data extraction and quality assessment were performed for included studies. Data were analyzed to identify key features that are associated with significant improvement in behavior. A total of 27 studies met inclusion criteria. Most (n = 15) were Web site interventions. Other delivery methods were text messages, games, multicomponent interventions, emails, and social media. Significant behavior change was often seen when interventions included education, goal setting, self-monitoring, and parental involvement. None of the publications reported cost-effectiveness. Due to heterogeneity of studies, meta-analysis was not feasible.It is possible to effect significant health behavior change in adolescents through digital interventions that incorporate education, goal setting, self-monitoring, and parental involvement. Most of the evidence relates to Web sites and further research into alternate media is needed, and longer term outcomes should be evaluated. There is a paucity of data on the cost-effectiveness of digital health interventions, and future trials should report these data. Copyright ¬© 2017 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

A systematic review of episodic volunteering in public health and other contexts	"Background: Episodic volunteers are a critical resource for public health non-profit activities but are poorly understood. A systematic review was conducted to describe the empirical evidence about episodic volunteering (EV) in the public health sector and more broadly. Study location, focus and temporal trends of EV research were also examined. Methods: Twelve key bibliographic databases (1990-April week 2, 2014) were searched, including Google Scholar. Empirical studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals that identified participants as EVs who volunteered to support Not-for-Profit organisations in the health and social welfare sectors were included. EV definitions, characteristics, economic costs, antecedents and outcomes and theoretical approaches were examined. Results: 41 articles met initial review criteria and 20 were specific to the health or social welfare sectors. EV definitions were based on one or more of three dimensions of duration, frequency, and task. EVs were predominantly female, middle aged, Caucasian (North American) and college/university educated. Fundraising was the most common EV activity and 72% had volunteered at least once. No studies examined the economic costs of EV. There was little consistency in EV antecedents and outcomes, except motives which primarily related to helping others, forming social connections, and self-psychological or physical enhancement. Most studies were atheoretical. Three authors proposed new theoretical frameworks. Conclusions: Research is required to underpin the development of an agreed consensus definition of EV. Moreover, an EV evidence-base including salient theories and measures is needed to develop EV engagement and retention strategies for the health and social welfare sectors."
A systematic review of factors affecting children's right to health in cluster randomized trials in Kenya	"Following the South African case, Treatment Action Campaign and Others v Minister of Health and Others, the use of 'pilot' studies to investigate interventions already proven efficacious, offered free of charge to government, but confined by the government to a small part of the population, may violate children's right to health, and the negative duty on governments not to prevent access to treatment. The applicants challenged a government decision to offer Nevirapine in a few pilot sites when evidence showed Nevirapine significantly reduced HIV transmission rates and despite donor offers of a free supply. The government refused to expand access, arguing they needed to collect more information, and citing concerns about long-term hazards, side effects, resistance and inadequate infrastructure. The court ruled this violated children's right to health and asked the government to immediately expand access. Cluster randomized trials involving children are increasingly popular, and are often used to reduce 'contamination': the possibility that members of a cluster adopt behavior of other clusters. However, they raise unique issues insufficiently addressed in literature and ethical guidelines. This case provides additional crucial guidance, based on a common human rights framework, for the Kenyan government and other involved stakeholders. Children possess special rights, often represent a 'captive' group, and so motivate extra consideration. In a systematic review, we therefore investigated whether cluster trial designs are used to prevent or delay children's access to treatment in Kenya or otherwise inconsistently with children's right to health as outlined in the above case. Although we did not find state sponsored cluster trials, most had significant public sector involvement. Core obligations under children's right to health were inadequately addressed across trials. Few cluster trials reported rationale for cluster randomization, offered post- trial access or planned to implement successful interventions. A small number of trials may have unnecessarily evaluated proven interventions, offered their control arm trial conditions worse than local standards of care or evaluated interventions ostensibly worse than local standards of care. Further research is required to establish if children's right to health in cluster trials is well understood and to explain why some obligations are unmet."
A Systematic Review of Family Witnessed Resuscitation and Family Witnessed Invasive Procedures in Adults in Hospital Settings Internationally - Part I: Perspectives of Patients and Families.	"BACKGROUND: Medicalization of care has removed family members from loved ones during critical events. Family Witnessed Resuscitation and Family Witnessed Invasive Procedures represent patient / family centered care options that can assist with having the family at the bedside during this perilous time. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to examine the evidence on FWR and FWIP in adults from the perspective of patients and relatives. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review considered studies involving adult patients and their relatives, in intensive care units, emergency departments, trauma rooms and general nursing wards.This review examined interventions used for the adoption/implementation of FWR and FWIP including but not limited to: formal policy and guidelines; family facilitator/chaperone role; educational programming; communication approaches; and debriefing.This review considered studies that included the following outcome measures for patients and family members: level of support; stress and anxiety; grief and bereavement; coping; psychological sequelae; and impact of family facilitator/chaperone role, formal family presence policy or protocols, educational programming, communication approaches, and debriefing.Any randomised controlled trials, controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, before and after studies, case series studies, and survey studies were considered for inclusion. SEARCH STRATEGY: A comprehensive multistep search was undertaken for English language published and unpublished studies from 1985-2010. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Retrieved papers were assessed for methodological quality independently by two reviewers, using appropriate JBI critical appraisal assessment tools. DATA COLLECTION: Findings were extracted using researcher-developed de novo tools, utilizing a framework of experiential, participant, and environmental factors influencing FWR/FWIP. The de novo tools best addressed the data collected. DATA SYNTHESIS: Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity; all the results of this review are presented in narrative form. RESULTS: 38 studies were retrieved and after critical appraisal a total of 15 studies were included. Of the seven patient studies, one was a match-control ""actual witness"" study representing JBI Level IIIA evidence and the remaining ""perception of witness"" studies were descriptive cross-sectional survey designs representing JBI Level IIIC evidence. Ten family member studies included four with ""actual witness"" and six with ""perception of witness."" All family member studies were descriptive cross-sectional survey designs representing JBI Level IIIC evidence. Two studies surveyed both patients and relatives, reducing the number of unique studies to 15. CONCLUSIONS: From the focus of family members with actual resuscitation experience and those with ""perception"" of witness, there exists strong support/preference for FWR across all countries in the included studies, and the belief that it is a right. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Health care organisations should provide family members the option to witness. There is insufficient evidence on FWIP to make policy recommendations. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: There is a need for well-designed randomised controlled designs that test the effectiveness of different approaches to FWR with outcomes that go beyond the level of support for the procedure. NOTE:: This is Part I of the systematic review report. Part I of the review report will explicate the perceptions of patients and family members on family witnessed resuscitation (FWR) and family witnessed invasive procedures (FWIP) in the adult population in emergency departments, intensive care units and general hospital wards internationally. Part II of the review report will explicate the perceptions of physicians, nurses and other healthcare providers regarding this phenomenon.Both review reports (part I and part II) are based on the same a priori approved review protocol. The decision to provide two review reports for one review protocol was justified for the sake of improved organization of the results. The volume of information from part I and part II, if combined, would make the review excessively long and difficult to read. Furthermore, some studies analysed the perspectives of both patients/families and healthcare providers. Thus, to minimize the risk of study selection bias, the reviewers decided that a separate round of critical appraisal and data extraction of studies was prudent in order to fully and independently explicate the perspectives of patients/families and healthcare providers.Furthermore, the textual component initially proposed in the approved review protocol was not included namely because the majority of FWR and FWIP protocols from the included studies could not be located for further analysis. Also, the reviewers determined that a separate systematic review that searches specifically for studies rich in textual information would be needed to truly capture the breadth of expert opinions and consensus statements on the issues of FWR and FWIP."
A systematic review of health impact assessments in the criminal justice system	"This study is a systematic review of the current and potential role of a public health tool or process called a health impact assessment (HIA) within the criminal justice system. The review explores the range of criminal justice policies, programs, and projects and their health impacts that have been evaluated by HIAs, and identifies strengths, challenges, and opportunities for the utilization of HIAs in the criminal justice system. Employing HIA clearinghouses and online databases, we conducted a two-phase sample selection that yielded 20 HIAs from the US, UK, Australia, and New Zealand for inclusion. The review analyzed key characteristics of the HIAs including setting, topic, stakeholder engagement levels, funding sources, methods, and recommendations. Factors like high stakeholder engagement, adequate time and staff capacities, and community leadership made HIAs more influential on decisions made. Three case studies highlight the impacts and successful application of HIAs conducted on criminal justice issues. Health impact assessments have potential as an influential tool or process to lead better policy and program decisions in criminal justice by contributing to increasing equity and improving health.

A systematic review of how patients value COPD outcomes.	"Our objective was to summarise systematically all research evidence related to how patients value outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).We conducted a systematic review (systematic review registration number CRD42015015206) by searching PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo and CINAHL, and included reports that assessed the relative importance of outcomes from COPD patients' perspective. Two authors independently determined the eligibility of studies, abstracted the eligible studies and assessed risk of bias. We narratively summarised eligible studies, meta-analysed utilities for individual outcomes and assessed the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations approach.We included 217 quantitative studies. Investigators most commonly used utility measurements of outcomes (n=136), discrete choice exercises (n=13), probability trade-off (n=4) and forced choice techniques (n=46). Patients rated adverse events as important but on average, less so than symptom relief. Exacerbation and hospitalisation due to exacerbation are the outcomes that COPD patients rate as most important. This systematic review provides a comprehensive registry of related studies.

A systematic review of interventions to reduce HIV-related stigma and discrimination from 2002 to 2013: how far have we come?	"INTRODUCTION: HIV-related stigma and discrimination continue to hamper efforts to prevent new infections and engage people in HIV treatment, care and support programmes. The identification of effective interventions to reduce stigma and discrimination that can be integrated into national responses is crucial to the success of the global AIDS response. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies and reports that assessed the effectiveness of interventions to reduce HIV stigma and discrimination between 1 January 2002 and 1 March 2013. Databases searched for peer-reviewed articles included PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO Host -CINAHL Plus, Psycinfo, Ovid, Sociofile and Popline. Reports were obtained from the www.HIVAIDSClearinghouse.eu, USAID Development Experience Clearinghouse, UNESCO HIV and AIDS Education Clearinghouse, Google, WHO and UNAIDS. Ancestry searches for articles included in the systematic review were also conducted. Studies of any design that sought to reduce stigma as a primary or secondary objective and included pre- and post-intervention measures of stigma were included. RESULTS: Of 2368 peer-reviewed articles and reports identified, 48 were included in our review representing 14 different target populations in 28 countries. The majority of interventions utilized two or more strategies to reduce stigma and discrimination, and ten included structural or biomedical components. However, most interventions targeted a single socio-ecological level and a single domain of stigma. Outcome measures lacked uniformity and validity, making both interpretation and comparison of study results difficult. While the majority of studies were effective at reducing the aspects of stigma they measured, none assessed the influence of stigma or discrimination reduction on HIV-related health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our review revealed considerable progress in the stigma-reduction field. However, critical challenges and gaps remain which are impeding the identification of effective stigma-reduction strategies that can be implemented by national governments on a larger scale. The development, validation, and consistent use of globally relevant scales of stigma and discrimination are a critical next step for advancing the field of research in this area. Studies comparing the effectiveness of different stigma-reduction strategies and studies assessing the influence of stigma reduction on key behavioural and biomedical outcomes are also needed to maximize biomedical prevention efforts."
A systematic review of maternal confidence for physiologic birth: characteristics of prenatal care and confidence measurement	"INTRODUCTION: Because a focus on physiologic labor and birth has reemerged in recent years, care providers have the opportunity in the prenatal period to help women increase confidence in their ability to give birth without unnecessary interventions. However, most research has only examined support for women during labor. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the research literature for information about prenatal care approaches that increase women's confidence for physiologic labor and birth and tools to measure that confidence. METHODS: Studies were reviewed that explored any element of a pregnant woman's interaction with her prenatal care provider that helped build confidence in her ability to labor and give birth. Timing of interaction with pregnant women included during pregnancy, labor and birth, and the postpartum period. In addition, we looked for studies that developed a measure of women's confidence related to labor and birth. Outcome measures included confidence or similar concepts, descriptions of components of prenatal care contributing to maternal confidence for birth, and reliability and validity of tools measuring confidence. RESULTS: The search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases provided a total of 893 citations. After removing duplicates and articles that did not meet inclusion criteria, 6 articles were included in the review. Three relate to women's confidence for labor during the prenatal period, and 3 describe tools to measure women's confidence for birth. DISCUSSION: Research about enhancing women's confidence for labor and birth was limited to qualitative studies. Results suggest that women desire information during pregnancy and want to use that information to participate in care decisions in a relationship with a trusted provider. Further research is needed to develop interventions to help midwives and physicians enhance women's confidence in their ability to give birth and to develop a tool to measure confidence for use during prenatal care.

A systematic review of outcomes of chronic disease self-management interventions	"PURPOSE: To carry out a systematic review of program outcomes used in the evaluation of group-based self-management interventions aimed at people with arthritis and other chronic conditions. METHODS: The systematic search was performed across databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Both between-group and within-group effect sizes (ES) were calculated. Results were interpreted as small (ES ~ 0.2), medium (ES ~ 0.5), or large (ES ~ 0.8) effects. RESULTS: The majority of 18 included trials investigated the effectiveness of arthritis-specific interventions. Across most outcomes, small effects on course participants were shown. While effects on knowledge were large (between-group ES = 0.78), effects on clinical outcomes such as pain (ES = 0.10) were negligible to small. CONCLUSIONS: This paper is consistent with other reviews in this area, suggesting that people with arthritis receive only marginal benefits from participating in chronic disease self-management interventions. When looking at the types of outcomes that trials are based on, however, alternative explanations for these results seem probable. As evaluations heavily rely on patient self-report, current approaches to program evaluation may not be sufficient to assess the intended impact of self-management education. An in-depth investigation of the types of outcomes assessed is provided in a separate paper."
A systematic review of patient heart failure self-care strategies	"BACKGROUND: Self-care is at the foundation for living with a chronic condition such as heart failure (HF). Patients with HF express difficulty with translating self-care knowledge into understanding ""how"" to engage in these activities and behaviors. Understanding the strategies that patients develop to engage in self-care will help healthcare providers (HCPs) improve support for unmet self-care needs of HF patients. The purpose of this systematic review was to highlight strategies that HF patients use to accommodate self-care recommendations into the reality of their daily lives. METHODS: A systematic review using qualitative meta-synthesis was carried out. Included studies had to contain a qualitative component and data pertaining to self-care of HF from adults older than 18 years and be published as full papers/theses beginning 1995. Ten databases were searched until March 19, 2012. RESULTS: Of 1421 papers identified by the search, 47 were included. Studies involved the following: 1377 patients, 45% women, mean age of 67 years (range, 25-98 years), 145 caregivers, and 15 HCPs. Approaches to self-care reflected both perception- and action-based strategies and were a means to effectively manage HF. Although HF patients often expressed difficulty on how to integrate self-care recommendations into their daily lives, they developed intentional, planned strategies that harnessed previous experiences. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare providers must appreciate that patients view self-care as an ""adaptation"" that they undertake to maintain their independence and quality of life. In addition, HCPs must recognize that because self-care is a process of learning over time from experience, an individualized approach that emphasizes how to self-care must be adopted for patients to develop the necessary HF self-care skills."
A systematic review of patient-reported and economic outcomes: value to stakeholders in the decision-making process in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus	"BACKGROUND: The need for an approach to measuring health results that incorporates patients' and payers' perspectives has generated a wide range of health care outcomes (HCOs), but it is yet unknown whether these HCOs are appropriate or valid for the health care decision-making process. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess HCOs, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and economic outcomes in terms of validity and appropriateness to health care decision making in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: This systematic review of studies published between January 1, 1996, and November 1, 2010, comprised an electronic literature search of MEDLINE and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases. Studies included were clinical trials, observational studies, economic analyses, and studies on the development and validation of HCOs in T2DM in the adult population. HCOs were assessed and classified according to their relevance for decision makers in terms of feasibility for routine use, validity, sensitivity, reliability, understanding, and scope. RESULTS: Two independent reviewers screened 4497 citations. Of these, 281 potentially eligible full articles were retrieved, and 185 met the inclusion criteria. A total of 121 HCOs in T2DM were identified: 80 (66.1%) PROs and 41 (33.9%) economic outcomes. Only 44.6% of the outcomes assessed were appropriate and valid for health care decision making. Greater deficiencies in evidence were found for PROs (61.3%), followed by economic outcomes (43.9%). CONCLUSIONS: A large number of HCOs are being used in the health care decision-making process, but a significant proportion of these new outcomes have not been properly validated. Despite the fact that appropriate measures will depend on the specific needs of the decision makers, researchers need to use HCOs for which evidence of quality and appropriateness is available.

A systematic review of peer-supported interventions for health promotion and disease prevention	"Prior research has examined peer programs with respect to specific peer roles (e.g.; peer support) or specific health/wellness domains (e.g.; exercise/diet), or have aggregated effects across roles and domains. We sought to conduct a systematic review that categorizes and assesses the effects of peer interventions to promote health and wellness by peer role, intervention type, and outcomes. We use evidence mapping to visually catalog and synthesize the existing research. We searched PubMed and WorldCat databases (2005 to 2015) and New York Academy of Medicine Grey Literature Report (1999 to 2016) for English-language randomized control trials. We extracted study design, study participants, type of intervention(s), peer role(s), outcomes assessed and measures used, and effects from 116 randomized controlled trials. Maps were created to provide a visual display of the evidence by intervention type, peer role, outcome type, and significant vs null or negative effects. There are more null than positive effects across peer interventions, with notable exceptions: group-based interventions that use peers as educators or group facilitators commonly improve knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions; peer educators also commonly improved social health/connectedness and engagement. Dyadic peer support influenced behavior change and peer counseling shows promising effects on physical health outcomes. Programs seeking to use peers in public health campaigns can use evidence maps to identify interventions that have previously demonstrated beneficial effects. Those seeking to produce health outcomes may benefit from identifying the mechanisms by which they expect their program to produce these effects and associated proximal outcomes for future evaluations.Prospero Registration Number: Although we attempted to register our protocol with PROSPERO, we did not meet eligibility criteria because we were past the data collection phase. The full PROSPERO-aligned protocol is available from the authors."
A systematic review of portable electronic technology for health education in resource-limited settings.	"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the literature of how portable electronic technologies with offline functionality are perceived and used to provide health education in resource-limited settings. METHODS: Three reviewers evaluated articles and performed a bibliography search to identify studies describing health education delivered by portable electronic device with offline functionality in low- or middle-income countries. Data extracted included: study population; study design and type of analysis; type of technology used; method of use; setting of technology use; impact on caregivers, patients, or overall health outcomes; and reported limitations. RESULTS: Searches yielded 5514 unique titles. Out of 75 critically reviewed full-text articles, 10 met inclusion criteria. Study locations included Botswana, Peru, Kenya, Thailand, Nigeria, India, Ghana, and Tanzania. Topics addressed included: development of healthcare worker training modules, clinical decision support tools, patient education tools, perceptions and usability of portable electronic technology, and comparisons of technologies and/or mobile applications. Studies primarily looked at the assessment of developed educational modules on trainee health knowledge, perceptions and usability of technology, and comparisons of technologies. Overall, studies reported positive results for portable electronic device-based health education, frequently reporting increased provider/patient knowledge, improved patient outcomes in both quality of care and management, increased provider comfort level with technology, and an environment characterized by increased levels of technology-based, informal learning situations. Negative assessments included high investment costs, lack of technical support, and fear of device theft. CONCLUSIONS: While the research is limited, portable electronic educational resources present promising avenues to increase access to effective health education in resource-limited settings, contingent on the development of culturally adapted and functional materials to be used on such devices."
A Systematic Review of Promising Strategies of Faith-Based Cancer Education and Lifestyle Interventions Among Racial/Ethnic Minority Groups	"Church-based interventions have been used to reach racial/ethnic minorities. In order to develop effective programs, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review of faith-based cancer prevention studies (2005~2016) to examine characteristics and promising strategies. Combination terms ""church or faith-based or religion,"" ""intervention or program,"" and ""cancer education or lifestyle"" were used in searching the five major databases: CINAHL; ERIC; Health Technology Assessments; MEDLINE; and PsycInfo. A total of 20 studies met study criteria. CDC's Community Guide was used to analyze and review group interventions. Analyses were organized by two racial groups: African American (AA) and Latino/Hispanic American groups."
A systematic review of reliable and valid tools for the measurement of patient participation in healthcare	"INTRODUCTION: Patient participation in healthcare is recognised internationally as essential for consumer-centric, high-quality healthcare delivery. Its measurement as part of continuous quality improvement requires development of agreed standards and measurable indicators. AIM: This systematic review sought to identify strategies to measure patient participation in healthcare and to report their reliability and validity. In the context of this review, patient participation was constructed as shared decision-making, acknowledging the patient as having critical knowledge regarding their own health and care needs and promoting self-care/autonomy. METHODS: Following a comprehensive search, studies reporting reliability or validity of an instrument used in a healthcare setting to measure patient participation, published in English between January 2004 and March 2014 were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: From an initial search, which identified 1582 studies, 156 studies were retrieved and screened against inclusion criteria. Thirty-three studies reporting 24 patient participation measurement tools met inclusion criteria, and were critically appraised. The majority of studies were descriptive psychometric studies using prospective, cross-sectional designs. Almost all the tools completed by patients, family caregivers, observers or more than one stakeholder focused on aspects of patient-professional communication. Few tools designed for completion by patients or family caregivers provided valid and reliable measures of patient participation. There was low correlation between many of the tools and other measures of patient satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Few reliable and valid tools for measurement of patient participation in healthcare have been recently developed. Of those reported in this review, the dyadic Observing Patient Involvement in Decision Making (dyadic-OPTION) tool presents the most promise for measuring core components of patient participation. There remains a need for further study into valid, reliable and feasible strategies for measuring patient participation as part of continuous quality improvement.

A systematic review of stakeholder engagement in comparative effectiveness and patient-centered outcomes research	"OBJECTIVES: We conducted a review of the peer-reviewed literature since 2003 to catalogue reported methods of stakeholder engagement in comparative effectiveness research and patient-centered outcomes research. METHODS AND RESULTS: We worked with stakeholders before, during and after the review was conducted to: define the primary and key research questions; conduct the literature search; screen titles, abstracts and articles; abstract data from the articles; and analyze the data. The literature search yielded 2,062 abstracts. The review was conducted on 70 articles that reported on stakeholder engagement in individual research projects or programs. FINDINGS: Reports of stakeholder engagement are highly variable in content and quality. We found frequent engagement with patients, modestly frequent engagement with clinicians, and infrequent engagement with stakeholders in other key decision-making groups across the healthcare system. Stakeholder engagement was more common in earlier (prioritization) than in later (implementation and dissemination) stages of research. The roles and activities of stakeholders were highly variable across research and program reports. RECOMMENDATIONS: To improve on the quality and content of reporting, we developed a 7-Item Stakeholder Engagement Reporting Questionnaire. We recommend three directions for future research: 1) descriptive research on stakeholder-engagement in research; 2) evaluative research on the impact of stakeholder engagement on the relevance, transparency and adoption of research; and 3) development and validation of tools that can be used to support stakeholder engagement in future work."
A systematic review of stakeholder perceptions of supervised injection facilities	"INTRODUCTION: Supervised injection facilities (SIFs) have been developed to address the public health burden associated with substance use. While these facilities have been associated with a number of positive outcomes, stakeholder opinion (the opinions of those potentially affected by these facilities) is likely to influence their future development. This systematic review aims to answer the question, ""how do stakeholders perceive SIFs?"" MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles were located through nine academic databases, by searching for grey literature, by contacting health departments in countries where SIFs have been implemented, by searching articles that cited included articles, and by searching the reference lists of included articles. Two reviewers screened all articles. Data was double-extracted and quality appraised. All extracted perceptions were analyzed by two coders. RESULTS: Forty-seven articles were synthesized. Key themes included (1) benefits of SIFs, such as the increased safety of people who use drugs (PWUD) and the education that was provided at these facilities; (2) concerns regarding SIFs, such as the location of these facilities and existing rules and regulations; and (3) suggestions for SIFs, such as changing restrictions and regulations. Perceptions often fluctuated between stakeholders with first-hand experience of SIFs (e.g. staff and PWUD) and stakeholders not involved in the operation of SIFs (e.g. the general public). CONCLUSION: The findings of this review illustrate how perceptions vary and align across different types of SIFs. Going forward, it will be important to draw on these insights to facilitate a more informed discussion on the implementation and continuation of these facilities. Copyright ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

"A systematic review of studies evaluating Australian indigenous community development projects: the extent of community participation, their methodological quality and their outcomes"	"BACKGROUND: Community development is a health promotion approach identified as having great potential to improve Indigenous health, because of its potential for extensive community participation. There has been no systematic examination of the extent of community participation in community development projects and little analysis of their effectiveness. This systematic review aims to identify the extent of community participation in community development projects implemented in Australian Indigenous communities, critically appraise the qualitative and quantitative methods used in their evaluation, and summarise their outcomes. METHODS: Ten electronic peer-reviewed databases and two electronic grey literature databases were searched for relevant studies published between 1990 and 2015. The level of community participation and the methodological quality of the qualitative and quantitative components of the studies were assessed against standardised criteria. RESULTS: Thirty one evaluation studies of community development projects were identified. Community participation varied between different phases of project development, generally high during project implementation, but low during the evaluation phase. For the majority of studies, methodological quality was low and the methods were poorly described. Although positive qualitative or quantitative outcomes were reported in all studies, only two studies reported statistically significant outcomes. DISCUSSION: Partnerships between researchers, community members and service providers have great potential to improve methodological quality and community participation when research skills and community knowledge are integrated to design, implement and evaluate community development projects. CONCLUSION: The methodological quality of studies evaluating Australian Indigenous community development projects is currently too weak to confidently determine the cost-effectiveness of community development projects in improving the health and wellbeing of Indigenous Australians. Higher quality studies evaluating community development projects would strengthen the evidence base."
A systematic review of studies with a representative sample of refugees and asylum seekers living in the community for participation in mental health research	"BACKGROUND: The aim was to review the literature to identify the most effective methods for creating a representative sample of refugee and asylum seeker groups living in the community to participate in health and mental health survey research. METHODS: A systematic search of academic and grey literature was conducted for relevant literature with 'hidden' groups published between January 1995 and January 2016. The main search used Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL and SCOPUS electronic databases. Hidden groups were defined as refugees, asylum seekers, stateless persons or hard/difficult to reach populations. A supplementary grey literature search was conducted. Identified articles were rated according to a created graded system of 'level of evidence for a community representative sample' based on key study factors that indicated possible sources of selection bias. Articles were included if they were assessed as having medium or higher evidence for a representative sample. All full-text papers that met the eligibility criteria were examined in detail and relevant data extracted. RESULTS: The searches identified a total of 20 publications for inclusion: 16 peer-reviewed publications and four highly relevant reports. Seventeen studies had sampled refugee and asylum seekers and three other hidden groups. The main search identified 12 (60.0%) and the grey search identified another eight (40.0%) articles. All 20 described sampling techniques for accessing hidden groups for participation in health-related research. Key design considerations were: an a priori aim to recruit a representative sample; a reliable sampling frame; recording of response rates; implementation of long recruitment periods; using multiple non-probability sampling methods; and, if possible, including a probability sampling component. Online social networking sites were used by one study. Engagement with the refugee and asylum seeker group was universally endorsed in the literature as necessary and a variety of additional efforts to do this were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The strategies for increasing the likelihood of a representative sample of this hidden group were identified and will assist researchers when doing future research with refugee groups. These findings encourage more rigorous reporting of future studies so that the representativeness of samples of these groups in research can be more readily assessed."
A systematic review of the barriers and facilitators to the provision and use of low-tech and unaided AAC systems for people with complex communication needs and their families.	"PURPOSE: Speech-language pathologists may introduce augmentative or alternative communication (AAC) systems to people who are unable to use speech for everyday communication. Despite the benefits of AAC systems, they are significantly underutilized by the people with complex communication needs. The current review aimed to synthesize the barriers and facilitators to the provision and use of low-tech and unaided AAC systems. Materials and methods: Relevant literature was identified via a systematic search strategy. Included articles (n = 43) were evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Qualitative framework analysis was then completed with reference to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). Results and conclusion: Most barriers and facilitators were coded as contextual factors within the ICF. Of most prominence were environmental factors, including attitudes of and supports provided by professionals, family members, and the society at large. Themes were also identified which related to the personal factors, including the user's own attitude, socioeconomic status, and culture. Beyond these contextual factors, the remaining codes related to body functions such as cognition and movement. There are numerous barriers to the provision and use of low-tech and unaided AAC systems, which may contribute to the inadequate use of these systems by people with complex communication needs. Suggestions for reducing these barriers are presented with regards to the person with complex communication needs, their family, and the professionals involved in their care. Implications for Rehabilitation AAC systems can reduce participation restrictions for people with complex communication needs. The provision and use of AAC systems is influenced by environmental factors, personal factors, and features of a person's body function. SLPs may need to collaborate with a large multidisciplinary team to successfully introduce AAC systems. SLP, teaching, and nursing students require theoretical and practical experience in AAC throughout their training to enable the provision and use of these systems."
A Systematic Review of the Current Status of Safer Conception Strategies for HIV Affected Heterosexual Couples in Sub-Saharan Africa	"We conducted a systematic review of safer conception strategies (SCS) for HIV-affected couples in sub-Saharan Africa to inform evidence-based safer conception interventions. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched fifteen electronic databases using the following inclusion criteria: SCS research in HIV-affected couples; published after 2007; in sub-Saharan Africa; primary research; peer-reviewed; and addressed a primary topic of interest (SCS availability, feasibility, and acceptability, and/or education and promotion). Researchers independently reviewed each study for eligibility using a standardized tool. We categorize studies by their topic area. We identified 41 studies (26 qualitative and 15 quantitative) that met inclusion criteria. Reviewed SCSs included: antiretroviral therapy (ART), pre-exposure prophylaxis, timed unprotected intercourse, manual/self-insemination, sperm washing, and voluntary male medical circumcision (VMMC). SCS were largely unavailable outside of research settings, except for general availability (i.e., not specifically for safer conception) of ART and VMMC. SCS acceptability was impacted by low client and provider knowledge about safer conception services, stigma around HIV-affected couples wanting children, and difficulty with HIV disclosure in HIV-affected couples. Couples expressed desire to learn more about SCS; however, provider training, patient education, SCS promotions, and integration of reproductive health and HIV services remain limited. Studies of provider training and couple-based education showed improvements in communication around fertility intentions and SCS knowledge. SCS are not yet widely available to HIV-affected African couples. Successful implementation of SCS requires that providers receive training on effective SCS and provide couple-based safer conception counseling to improve disclosure and communication around fertility intentions and reproductive health."
A systematic review of the effectiveness of stroke self-management programs for improving function and participation outcomes: self-management programs for stroke survivors	"PURPOSE: A systematic review of stroke self-management programs was conducted to: (i) identify how many and what self-management support strategies were included in stroke self-management interventions and (ii) describe whether self-management programs effectively improved outcomes, focusing specifically on function and participation outcomes. METHODS: Twelve databases were searched for the years 1986-2012 to identify self-management programs for stroke survivors. Pre-post, quasi-experimental and randomized controlled trial study designs were included. Descriptive information about the intervention was scrutinized to identify what self-management support strategies were present in the intervention and comparisons were made between programs using a group versus a one-to-one format. All outcomes were included and categorized. RESULTS: The most prominent strategies identified in our review were goal setting and follow-up, and an individualized approach using structured information and professional support. There are indications that self-management programs can significantly increase participation and functional ability. However, the high level of clinical heterogeneity in program delivery, outcomes and level of stroke severity made it impossible to conduct a meta-analysis. Further examination of individual self-management support strategies, such as linking rehabilitation goal setting to post-acute self-management programs, the inclusion of family members and the contribution of peer-support is warranted. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Self-management programs for stroke survivors. Linking post-acute self-management programs to rehabilitation goal setting could improve outcomes. Involving family members in self-management programs may benefit stroke survivors."
A systematic review of the evidence on service user involvement in interpersonal skills training of mental health students	"Service user involvement has become a common feature of education programmes for mental health students. However, little is known about the effects of this type of education on the interpersonal skills of students taking part. This paper reports findings from a systematic review that formed part of a wider investigation into service user involvement in teaching interpersonal skills. The review aimed to locate and assess the quality of the published evidence relating to the effects of service user involvement on mental health students interpersonal skills and to synthesize results, using a definition of interpersonal skill that includes attitudes, empathy and skills as its key components."
A systematic review of the experiences of vulnerable people participating in research on sensitive topics	"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to systematically review studies that discuss the experiences of vulnerable populations participating in research on sensitive topics. DESIGN: Systematic review performed according to PRISMA guidelines. DATA SOURCES: Thirteen databases were searched, locating 197 articles. Following removal of duplicates, screening and full text review, 31 studies remained to be critically appraised. REVIEW METHODS: As there was a mix of qualitative and quantitative articles, the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) toolkit and Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) tool were used to appraise the methodological quality of the articles. Following critical appraisal, the remaining 11 articles were synthesised narratively to identify common themes across the studies. RESULTS: Despite some reports of distress, responses from participants were overwhelmingly positive. There was a strong link between symptomatology and potential for distress; however, the majority of those who did experience some level of discomfort stated they would still participate in future research. Three major themes were extracted: ""It was worth it""; ""Even if it hurt, I would do it again"" and ""Risk or benefit: fixing the location on the continuum"". CONCLUSION: Although researchers frequently experience obstacles and the phenomenon known as ""gatekeeping"" when attempting to conduct research amongst vulnerable populations, there is little evidence of harm to participants. On the contrary, there is evidence of benefit for participants and evidence that they are willing to participate if given the opportunity. Although well-meaning, the actions of gatekeepers are not only paternalistic, they could be further marginalising vulnerable populations by denying them the benefits to be gained from research designed to identify and begin addressing their needs.

A systematic review of the factors influencing African Americans' participation in cancer clinical trials.	"Objective: This systematic review was conducted to synthesize the existing evidence regarding key considerations influencing African Americans' participation in cancer clinical trials (CCTs). Methods: The PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed publications during the last decade (2002-2011) that met our inclusionary criteria. Our search utilized Boolean combinations of the following terms: ""clinical trial""; ""cancer""; ""neoplasm""; ""African American""; ""Black""; ""caregiver""; ""decision making""; ""recruitment""; ""companion""; ""family""; ""significant other""; and ""social support"". Results: A total of 267 articles were identified in the database searches. Of these articles, a total of 31 were determined to meet the inclusion criteria and were retained for review. Key issues that emerged as impediments to a successful recruitment of African Americans to CCTs included negative attitudes towards clinical trials, low levels of knowledge and awareness regarding CCTs, religious beliefs, and structural barriers, such as transportation, childcare, and access to health care. Recommendations from physicians, family members, and friends may promote CCT participation. Multimedia, and culturally-appropriate recruitment approaches may also be effective in soliciting participation among African Americans. Conclusion: Existing research underscores the importance of social support from family and friends, cultural appropriateness and sensitivity from physicians and in the design of the CCT, and enhanced education among African Americans in decision-making processes. As African Americans are underrepresented in CCTs, targeted strategies to enhance recruitment efforts and improve cancer treatment outcomes are essential. ¬© 2013."
"A systematic review of the impact of patient and public involvement on service users, researchers and communities"	"OBJECTIVE: Patient and public involvement (PPI) in research has expanded nationally and internationally over the last decade, and recently there has been significant attention given to understanding its impact on research. Less attention has been given to the impact of PPI on the people involved, yet it has been shown that the success of PPI in research can be reliant on the processes of engagement between these individuals and communities. This paper therefore critically explores the impact of PPI on service users, researchers and communities involved in health and social care research. DATA SOURCES: Searches were undertaken from 1995 to April 2012 in the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane library, CINAHL, HMIC and HELMIS. Searches were undertaken for grey literature using the databases InvoNet and NHS Evidence. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they included the impact of PPI on individual service users, researchers or communities under research. Studies were excluded if they were in a foreign language (unless they were deemed critical to the systematic review) or were in children and adolescent services. STUDY APPRAISAL: Data were extracted using a narrative synthesis, and quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. MAIN RESULTS: Service users reported feeling empowered and valued, gaining confidence and life skills. Researchers developed a greater understanding and insight into their research area, gaining respect and a good rapport with the community. The community involved in research became more aware and knowledgeable about their condition. However, lack of preparation and training led some service users to feel unable to contribute to the research, while other service users and communities reported feeling overburdened with the work involved. Researchers reported difficulties in incorporating PPI in meaningful ways due to lack of money and time. CONCLUSION: This is the first international systematic review to focus on the impact of PPI on the people involved in the process. The beneficial and challenging impacts reported highlight the importance of optimising the context and processes of involvement, so creating the potential for PPI to impact positively on the research itself."
A systematic review of the literature on self-management interventions and discussion of their potential relevance for people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa	"OBJECTIVE: This study systematically reviews the literature on self-management interventions provided by health care teams, community partners, patients and families and discusses the potential relevance of these interventions for people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We searched major databases for literature published between 1995 and 2012. 52 studies were included in this review. RESULTS: The review found very few studies covering people living with HIV and generally inconclusive evidence to inform the development of chronic care policy and practice in sub-Saharan Africa. CONCLUSION: Chronic care models and self-management interventions for sub-Saharan Africa has not been a research priority. Furthermore, the results question the applicability of these models and interventions in sub-Saharan Africa. There is a need for studies to fill this gap in view of the rapidly increasing number of people needing chronic care services in Africa. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The established practices for long-term support for HIV patients are still the most valid basis for promoting self-management. This will be the case until there are more studies which assess those practices and their effect on self-management outcomes and other studies which assess the utility and feasibility of applying chronic care models that have been developed in high-income countries.

A Systematic Review of the Literature on the Sustainability of Community Health Collaboratives	"Recent interest in community health collaboratives has been driven by the potential of these types of organizations to solve complex health problems at the local level by bringing together stakeholders that have traditionally operated independently, and often at cross-purposes. Much of the work that is central to the mission of collaboratives can take years to reach fruition, however, and there are a number of challenges to sustaining their activities. In this article, we systematically reviewed the theoretical and empirical literature on health care collaborative sustainability, focusing on definitions and antecedents of sustainability. Given the diversity and fragmentation of this literature, we used this review as a foundation to develop a synthesized definition, conceptual groups of antecedents, and potential research propositions to help guide future research, planning, and practice of sustainable community health collaboratives.

A systematic review of web-based interventions for patient empowerment and physical activity in chronic diseases: relevance for cancer survivors	"BACKGROUND: Patient empowerment reflects the ability of patients to positively influence their health and health behavior such as physical activity. While interactive Web-based interventions are increasingly used in various chronic disease settings to enhance empowerment and physical activity, such interventions are still uncommon for cancer survivors. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature regarding interactive Web-based interventions. We focused on interventions aimed at increasing patient empowerment and physical activity for various chronic conditions, and explored their possible relevance for cancer survivors. METHODS: Searches were performed in PubMed, Embase, and Scopus to identify peer-reviewed papers reporting on randomized controlled trials that studied the effects of Web-based interventions. These interventions were developed for adults with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, or cancer. Intervention characteristics, effects on patient empowerment and physical activity, information on barriers to and facilitators of intervention use, users' experiences, and methodological quality were assessed. Results were summarized in a qualitative way. We used the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) regarding cancer survivorship care to explore the relevance of the interventions for cancer survivors. RESULTS: We included 19 papers reporting on trials with 18 unique studies. Significant, positive effects on patient empowerment were reported by 4 studies and 2 studies reported positive effects on physical activity. The remaining studies yielded mixed results or no significant group differences in these outcomes (ie, no change or improvement for all groups). Although the content, duration, and frequency of interventions varied considerably across studies, commonly used elements included education, self-monitoring, feedback/tailored information, self-management training, personal exercise program, and communication (eg, chat, email) with either health care providers or patients. Limited information was found on barriers, facilitators, and users' experiences. Methodological quality varied, with 13 studies being of moderate quality. The reported Web-based intervention elements appeared to be highly relevant to address the specific needs of cancer survivors as indicated by the IOM. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 7 common elements of interactive, Web-based interventions in chronic disease settings that could possibly be translated into eHealth recommendations for cancer survivors. While further work is needed to determine optimal intervention characteristics, the work performed in other chronic disease settings provides a basis for the design of an interactive eHealth approach to improve patient empowerment and physical activity in cancer survivors. This may subsequently improve their health status and quality of life and reduce their need for supportive care."
"A Systematic Review of Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) in the United States: Methodologies, Youth Outcomes, and Future Directions."	"OBJECTIVES: To use a systematic review methodology to describe the state of the youth participatory action research (YPAR) literature and synthesize findings about the youth outcomes reported in these studies. METHODS: We screened and coded studies using a process consistent with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Of the 3,724 articles found in the database search, 67 reports of 63 distinct studies were included in the final sample. These reports were coded for reports of YPAR principles and project characteristics, study methods, and reported youth outcomes. RESULTS: The YPAR literature comprises predominantly qualitative studies, with only two randomized trials. The most common outcomes associated with participation in YPAR were those related to agency and leadership (75.0%), followed by academic or career (55.8%), social (36.5%), interpersonal (34.6%), and cognitive (23.1%) outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides emerging evidence of the skills and competencies youth may develop through YPAR and offers methodological recommendations for future research that can provide greater evidence of causality."
A systematic review to identify system-related elements that can be used to evaluate community-based rehabilitation (CBR) programmes	"The article discusses a systematic review to identify system-related elements that can be used to evaluate community-based rehabilitation (CBR) programs. It identified twenty-five system evaluation elements from the current literature addressing outcomes in the health, empowerment and social domains of the CBR matrix. It suggests further monitoring and evaluation for CBR to develop a comprehensive evidence-based tool kit for CBR and enhancing its education and livelihood domains."
A systematic review to quantitatively evaluate 'Stepping Stones': a participatory community-based HIV/AIDS prevention intervention	"This first independent systematic review examined evidence for the effectiveness of the stepping stones intervention in HIV prevention. To reduce HIV transmission it addresses gender roles and promotes equitable relationships. Biomedical, behavioural and psychosocial outcomes extracted from six databases and 'grey' literature identified eight reports of seven studies (n = 14,630) from India, Gambia, S. Africa, Ethiopia, Angola, Tanzania, Uganda and Fiji. Infection incidence tested in the only RCT showed no significant reduction in HIV, although HSV-2 decreased. Condom use increased (two countries out of eight). Risk reduction results were mixed for declining alcohol misuse (two studies in three) and multiple partners (one in two). Communicating HIV information to partners, family or community improved (three studies from seven). Gender inequity was reduced in India (one in five), but stigma decreased in four studies. Future investigations of diverse cultures and older adults should select high quality biomedical and quality of life measures."
A Thematic Synthesis of the Experiences of Adults Living with Hemodialysis	"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients on in-center dialysis spend significant amounts of time in the dialysis unit; additionally, managing ESRD affects many aspects of life outside the dialysis unit. To improve the care provided to patients requiring hemodialysis, their experiences and beliefs regarding treatment must be understood. This systematic review aimed to synthesize the experiences of patients receiving in-center hemodialysis. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We searched Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Google Scholar, and reference lists for primary qualitative studies published from 1995 to 2015 that explored the experiences of adult patients receiving treatment with in-center hemodialysis. A thematic synthesis was conducted. RESULTS: Seventeen studies involving 576 patients were included in the synthesis. Four analytic themes were developed. The first theme (a new dialysis-dependent self) describes the changes in identity and perceptions of self that could result from dialysis dependence. The second theme (a restricted life) describes the physical and emotional constraints that patients described as a consequence of their dependence. Some patients reported strategies that allowed them to regain a sense of optimism and influence over the future, and these contributed to the third theme (regaining control). The first three themes describe a potential for change through acceptance, adaption, and regaining a sense of control. The final theme (relationships with health professionals) describes the importance of these relationships for in-center patients and their influence on perceptions of power and support. These relationships are seen to influence the other three themes through information sharing, continuity, and personalized support. CONCLUSIONS: Our synthesis has resulted in a framework that can be used to consider interventions to improve patients' experiences of in-center hemodialysis care. Focusing on interventions that are incorporated into the established relationships that patients have with their health care professionals may enable patients to progress toward a sense of control and improve satisfaction with care.

Access to mental health in primary care: a qualitative meta-synthesis of evidence from the experience of people from 'hard to reach' groups	"Knowledge about depression, access and help-seeking has increasingly been influenced from a range of disciplines including clinical and applied social science. A range of interventions can improve outcomes of depression and anxiety. However, many in need do not seek help, or their interaction with care-givers does not address their needs. We carried out a systematic search for qualitative articles focusing on the experiences of eight exemplar groups with exceptional problems in access (the homeless, long-term unemployed, adolescents with eating disorders, depressed elderly people, advanced cancer sufferers, patients with medically unexplained symptoms, asylum seekers and people from black and minority ethnic groups). Twenty articles representing these groups were selected, findings were then developed using qualitative meta-synthesis, this suggested a range of mechanisms accounting for poor access among these groups. Many regarded their mental health problems as rooted in social problems and employed a variety of self-management strategies to maintain function. These strategies could involve social withdrawal, focusing available resources on close family relationships and work roles. Over-investment in these roles could result in a sense of insecurity as wider networks were neglected. Material disadvantage affected both the resources people could bring to performing social roles and influenced help-seeking. A tacit understanding of the material, psychological and social 'costs' of engagement by patients and health professionals could influence decisions to seek and offer help. These costs were felt to be proportionally higher in deprived, marginalized and minority communities, where individual resources are limited and the stigma attached to mental ill-health is high."
Achieving successful community engagement: a rapid realist review	"BACKGROUND: Community engagement is increasingly seen as crucial to achieving high quality, efficient and collaborative care. However, organisations are still searching for the best and most effective ways to engage citizens in the shaping of health and care services. This review highlights the barriers and enablers for engaging communities in the planning, designing, governing, and/or delivering of health and care services on the macro or meso level. It provides policymakers and professionals with evidence-based guiding principles to implement their own effective community engagement (CE) strategies. METHODS: A Rapid Realist Review was conducted to investigate how interventions interact with contexts and mechanisms to influence the effectiveness of CE. A local reference panel, consisting of health and care professionals and experts, assisted in the development of the research questions and search strategy. The panel's input helped to refine the review's findings. A systematic search of the peer-reviewed literature was conducted. RESULTS: Eight action-oriented guiding principles were identified: Ensure staff provide supportive and facilitative leadership to citizens based on transparency; foster a safe and trusting environment enabling citizens to provide input; ensure citizens' early involvement; share decision-making and governance control with citizens; acknowledge and address citizens' experiences of power imbalances between citizens and professionals; invest in citizens who feel they lack the skills and confidence to engage; create quick and tangible wins; take into account both citizens' and organisations' motivations. CONCLUSIONS: An especially important thread throughout the CE literature is the influence of power imbalances and organisations' willingness, or not, to address such imbalances. The literature suggests that 'meaningful participation' of citizens can only be achieved if organisational processes are adapted to ensure that they are inclusive, accessible and supportive of citizens."
Action research in the healthcare field: a scoping review.	"OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to explore international literature related to the application of action research in studies in the healthcare context. INTRODUCTION: Action research is an approach that involves collaboration to develop a process through knowledge building and social change. Several viewpoints of action research have been introduced as the different traditions of developed action research. To develop a coherent process, researchers have to posit their worldviews and theoretical framework and align these with the research aims and procedures, and local transformation needs. This diversity leads to a variety of action research practices in healthcare. Particularly, in this review, we raised the need for examining participants' experiences and changes related to the action research process. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This scoping review considered studies that included any professional healthcare provider, patient or recipient of healthcare products or services involved in action research. Studies that used the action research methodology in the healthcare context were included. All quantitative and qualitative studies were considered. The quantitative component considered experimental and epidemiological studies, whereas the qualitative component considered studies that focused on qualitative data. METHODS: A three-step search strategy was used in this review. MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Social Sciences, ERIC, PsycINFO, Health Source, ScienceDirect, Wiley and SciELO databases were searched with no publication date limitation. Studies published in English, Portuguese and Spanish were included. The data were extracted using a charting table, which was developed to record key information from sources relevant to the review question. The findings were descriptively presented, with tables and figures to support the data when appropriate. RESULTS: We included 124 studies with different aims and procedures. The levels of participation ranged from no real input into or influence on the research process to democratic knowledge sharing and collective understanding. The action research processes occurred in diverse settings in the healthcare context, and participants with different objectives and demands took part in the research.From study objectives, knowledge building, and social change data, we developed three domains and categorized the studies. In general, Europe and Australia published more studies in the organizational domain and mainly had healthcare stakeholders as participants. North America published more studies in the individual domain, and Latin America, the continent with a higher percentage of publications, published studies that were more frequently related to the collective domain. Asia and Africa did not have a consistent number of publications. There was a major repercussion on the health promotion perspective in North America and Latin America. CONCLUSIONS: There are several ways of conducting action research in healthcare that consider the researcher's aims and theoretical assumptions. Further qualitative systematic review questions may arise from the results and conclusions of this scoping review."
Action research studies in the intensive care setting: a systematic review	"OBJECTIVES: To review published studies using action research in the intensive care unit (ICU) in order to provide an intervention framework to improve clinical outcomes. DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: Searches of the electronic databases: Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); Scopus, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and the World Wide Web were undertaken using MeSH key words including: 'action research'; 'health care research', 'health services evaluation'; 'intensive care unit'. Reference lists of retrieved articles was also undertaken to identify further articles. All studies were reviewed by two authors using a critical appraisal tool. RESULTS: The search strategy generated 195 articles. Only 21 studies projects were identified using action research in the ICU. The majority of studies were conducted in the United Kingdom. The participants in the action research studies ranged from 6 to 253. Predominately studies using action research involved nurses in collaboration with patients and family and other health care practitioners to address identified problems in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this review it appears that action research is a promising methodological approach to address clinical practice improvement in the ICU. Studies retrieved focussed primarily on process and formative evaluation but not on clinical outcomes. There is a need to incorporate outcome assessment in action research in the ICU to increase the framework of action research to improve clinical outcomes. Copyright ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Active involvement of people with intellectual disabilities in health research - A structured literature review.	"Actively involving people with intellectual disabilities (ID) in health research, also known as inclusive health research, is increasingly popular. Currently, insight into experiences of this type of research is scarce. To gain insight into this topic, a structured literature review was conducted focussing on (1) existing theories, (2) inclusive methods, (3) added value and (4) barriers and facilitators. Literature published between January 2000 and January 2014 was included covering keywords related to ID and inclusive health research. Searches were performed in Pubmed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, resulting in 26 included papers. Papers were quality assessed and analysed using qualitative data analysis software. Four theories were often simultaneously addressed: participatory research, emancipatory research, inclusive research and Arnstein's ladder. Barriers and facilitators could be divided into preparing, undertaking and finalising phases of research. Authors indicated that their motivation to conduct inclusive health research was based on demands by policy and funding bodies or was based on ethical considerations (i.e., ethical notions and giving people with ID a voice). Upon completion, authors perceived increased quality and validity of their research and several benefits for stakeholders (i.e., people with ID, researchers and healthcare professionals). Overall, there was consistency in their perception of the most important aspects of inclusive health research. Based on the analysis of included papers, four recommendations of inclusive health research with people with ID were found. Inclusive health research should be: (1) tailoring to the specific study; (2) anticipating all stakeholders; (3) considering its added value; and (4) providing insight into its process."
Activity monitors for increasing physical activity in adult stroke survivors	"BACKGROUND: Stroke is the third leading cause of disability worldwide. Physical activity is important for secondary stroke prevention and for promoting functional recovery. However, people with stroke are more inactive than healthy age-matched controls. Therefore, interventions to increase activity after stroke are vital to reduce stroke-related disability. OBJECTIVES: To summarise the available evidence regarding the effectiveness of commercially available, wearable activity monitors and smartphone applications for increasing physical activity levels in people with stroke. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and the following clinical trial registers: WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinical Trials, EU Clinical Trial Register, ISRCTN Registry, Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry, and Stroke Trials Registry to 3 March 2018. We also searched reference lists, Web of Science forward tracking, and Google Scholar, and contacted trial authors to obtain further data if required. We did not restrict the search on language or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and randomised cross-over trials that included use of activity monitors versus no intervention, another type of intervention, or other activity monitor. Participants were aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of stroke, in hospital or living in the community. Primary outcome measures were steps per day and time in moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity. Secondary outcomes were sedentary time, time spent in light intensity physical activity, walking duration, fatigue, mood, quality of life, community participation and adverse events. We excluded upper limb monitors that only measured upper limb activity. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology to analyse and interpret the data. At least two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion. We resolved disagreements by consulting a third review author. We extracted the following data from included studies into a standardised template: type of study, participant population, study setting, intervention and co-interventions, time-frame, and outcomes. We graded levels of bias as high, low, or unclear, and assessed the quality of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We retrieved 28,098 references, from which we identified 29 potential articles. Four RCTs (in 11 reports) met the inclusion criteria.The sample sizes ranged from 27 to 135 (total 245 participants). Time poststroke varied from less than one week (n = 1), to one to three months (n = 2), or a median of 51 months (n = 1). Stroke severity ranged from a median of one to six on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Three studies were conducted in inpatient rehabilitation, and one was in a university laboratory. All studies compared use of activity monitor plus another intervention (e.g. a walking retraining programme or an inpatient rehabilitation programme) versus the other intervention alone. Three studies reported on the primary outcome of daily step counts.There was no clear effect for the use of activity monitors in conjunction with other interventions on step count in a community setting (mean difference (MD) -1930 steps, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4410 to 550; 1 RCT, 27 participants; very low-quality evidence), or in an inpatient rehabilitation setting (MD 1400 steps, 95% CI -40 to 2840; 2 RCTs, 83 participants; very low-quality evidence). No studies reported the primary outcome moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, but one did report time spent in moderate and vigorous intensity activity separately: this study reported that an activity monitor in addition to usual inpatient rehabilitation increased the time spent on moderate intensity physical activity by 4.4 minutes per day (95% CI 0.28 to 8.52; 1 RCT, 48 participants; low-quality evidence) compared with usual rehabilitation alone, but there was no clear effect for the use of an activity monitor plus usual rehabilitation for increasing time spent in vigorous intensity physical activity compared to usual rehabilitation (MD 2.6 minutes per day, 95% CI -0.8 to 6; 1 RCT, 48 participants; low-quality evidence). The overall risk of bias was low, apart from high-risk for blinding of participants and study personnel. None of the included studies reported any information relating to adverse effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Only four small RCTs with 274 participants (three in inpatient rehabilitation and one in the community) have examined the efficacy of activity monitors for increasing physical activity after stroke. Although these studies showed activity monitors could be incorporated into practice, there is currently not enough evidence to support the use of activity monitors to increase physical activity after stroke."
Adopting Telemedicine for the Self-Management of Hypertension: Systematic Review	"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a chronic condition that affects adults of all ages. In the United States, 1 in 3 adults has hypertension, and about half of the hypertensive population is adequately controlled. This costs the nation US $46 billion each year in health care services and medications required for treatment and missed workdays. Finding easier ways of managing this condition is key to successful treatment. OBJECTIVE: A solution to reduce visits to physicians for chronic conditions is to utilize telemedicine. Research is limited on the effects of utilizing telemedicine in health care facilities. There are potential benefits for implementing telemedicine programs with patients dealing with chronic conditions. The purpose of this review was to weigh the facilitators against the barriers for implementing telemedicine. METHODS: Searches were methodically conducted in the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Complete (CINAHL Complete) via Elton B Stephens Company (EBSCO) and PubMed (which queries MEDLINE) to collect information about self-management of hypertension through the use of telemedicine. RESULTS: Results identify facilitators and barriers corresponding to the implementation of self-management of hypertension using telemedicine. The most common facilitators include increased access, increase in health and quality, patient knowledge and involvement, technology growth with remote monitoring, cost-effectiveness, and increased convenience/ease. The most prevalent barriers include lack of evidence, self-management difficult to maintain, no long-term results/more areas to address, and long-term added workload commitment. CONCLUSIONS: This review guides health care professionals in incorporating new practices and identifying the best methods to introduce telemedicine into their practices. Understanding the facilitators and barriers to implementation is important, as is understanding how these factors will impact a successful implementation of telemedicine in the area of self-management of hypertension.

Adult burn survivors' personal experiences of rehabilitation: An integrative review.	"Burn rehabilitation is a lengthy process associated with physical and psychosocial problems. As a critical area in burn care, the aim was to systematically synthesise the literature focussing on personal perceptions and experiences of adult burn survivors' rehabilitation and to identify factors that influence their rehabilitation. Studies were identified through an electronic search using the databases: PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Scopus, PsycINFO and Trove of peer reviewed research published between 2002 and 2012 limited to English-language research with search terms developed to reflect burn rehabilitation. From the 378 papers identified, 14 research papers met the inclusion criteria. Across all studies, there were 184 participants conducted in eight different countries. The reported mean age was 41 years with a mean total body surface area (TBSA) burn of 34% and the length of stay ranging from one day to 68 months. Significant factors identified as influential in burn rehabilitation were the impact of support, coping and acceptance, the importance of work, physical changes and limitations. This review suggests there is a necessity for appropriate knowledge and education based programmes for burn survivors with consideration given to the timing and delivery of education to facilitate the rehabilitation journey. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI."

Amplifying Each Patient's Voice: A Systematic Review of Multi-criteria Decision Analyses Involving Patients	"BACKGROUND: Qualitative methods tend to be used to incorporate patient preferences into healthcare decision making. However, for patient preferences to be given adequate consideration by decision makers they need to be quantified. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is one way to quantify and capture the patient voice. The objective of this review was to report on existing MCDAs involving patients to support the future use of MCDA to capture the patient voice. METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched in June 2014 for English-language papers with no date restriction. The following search terms were used: 'multi-criteria decision*', 'multiple criteria decision*', 'MCDA', 'benefit risk assessment*', 'risk benefit assessment*', 'multicriteri* decision*', 'MCDM', 'multi-criteri* decision*'. Abstracts were included if they reported the application of MCDA to assess healthcare interventions where patients were the source of weights. Abstracts were excluded if they did not apply MCDA, such as discussions of how MCDA could be used; or did not evaluate healthcare interventions, such as MCDAs to assess the level of health need in a locality. Data were extracted on weighting method, variation in patient and expert preferences, and discussion on different weighting techniques. RESULTS: The review identified ten English-language studies that reported an MCDA to assess healthcare interventions and involved patients as a source of weights. These studies reported 12 applications of MCDA. Different methods of preference elicitation were employed: direct weighting in workshops; discrete choice experiment surveys; and the analytical hierarchy process using both workshops and surveys. There was significant heterogeneity in patient responses and differences between patients, who put greater weight on disease characteristics and treatment convenience, and experts, who put more weight on efficacy. The studies highlighted cognitive challenges associated with some weighting methods, though patients' views on their ability to undertake weighting tasks was positive. CONCLUSION: This review identified several recent examples of MCDA used to elicit patient preferences, which support the feasibility of using MCDA to capture the patient voice. Challenges identified included, how best to reflect the heterogeneity of patient preferences in decision making and how to manage the cognitive burden associated with some MCDA tasks."
An integrative model of patient-centeredness - a systematic review and concept analysis	"BACKGROUND: Existing models of patient-centeredness reveal a lack of conceptual clarity. This results in a heterogeneous use of the term, unclear measurement dimensions, inconsistent results regarding the effectiveness of patient-centered interventions, and finally in difficulties in implementing patient-centered care. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the different dimensions of patient-centeredness described in the literature and to propose an integrative model of patient-centeredness based on these results. METHODS: Protocol driven search in five databases, combined with a comprehensive secondary search strategy. All articles that include a definition of patient-centeredness were eligible for inclusion in the review and subject to subsequent content analysis. Two researchers independently first screened titles and abstracts, then assessed full texts for eligibility. In each article the given definition of patient-centeredness was coded independently by two researchers. We discussed codes within the research team and condensed them into an integrative model of patient-centeredness. RESULTS: 4707 records were identified through primary and secondary search, of which 706 were retained after screening of titles and abstracts. 417 articles (59%) contained a definition of patient-centeredness and were coded. 15 dimensions of patient-centeredness were identified: essential characteristics of clinician, clinician-patient relationship, clinician-patient communication, patient as unique person, biopsychosocial perspective, patient information, patient involvement in care, involvement of family and friends, patient empowerment, physical support, emotional support, integration of medical and non-medical care, teamwork and teambuilding, access to care, coordination and continuity of care. In the resulting integrative model the dimensions were mapped onto different levels of care. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed integrative model of patient-centeredness allows different stakeholders to speak the same language. It provides a foundation for creating better measures and interventions. It can also be used to inform the development of clinical guidance documents and health policy directives, and through this support the shift towards patient-centered health care."
"An integrative review exploring black men of African and Caribbean backgrounds, their fears of prostate cancer and their attitudes towards screening"	"Evidence suggests that black men are disproportionately more affected than any other ethnicity by prostate cancer. The aim of this review is to identify studies exploring black men of African and Caribbean descent, their fears of prostate cancer and their attitudes towards screening. Four databases were searched and reference lists of relevant papers were hand searched. The inclusion criteria were studies exploring attitudes towards screening and fear of prostate cancer in black men of African and Caribbean backgrounds, peer-reviewed research, qualitative studies, surveys, questionnaires and English language publications. Qualitative findings were synthesized using a thematic framework to which quantitative findings were integrated. Of the 16 papers, 10 were quantitative and 6 were qualitative, all of which were conducted in the United States of America. Poorer and less educated black men were reluctant to seek help for prostate cancer. They may not visit their doctors for fear of intrusion into their personal lives. Moreover, they were fearful of being emasculated as a result of the digital rectal examination. The review identifies a paucity of UK literature on black men's fears and perceptions of prostate cancer. Further studies are needed in the United Kingdom to address this gap in the literature."
An Integrative Review of Communication Between Parents and Nurses of Hospitalized Technology-Dependent Children	"ABSTRACT Background With advances in health care, the population of children who are technology-dependent is increasing and, therefore, the need for nurses to understand how best to engage in communication with the parents of these children is critical. Shared communication between the parents of hospitalized technology-dependent children and their nurses is essential to provide optimal care for the child. The components and behaviors of the parent-nurse communication process that improve mutual understanding of optimal care for the child had not previously been examined. Research Question Among parents of hospitalized technology-dependent children and their nurses, what communication behaviors, components, concepts, or processes improve mutual understanding of optimal care for the child? Methods An integrative review of both qualitative and quantitative studies was conducted. Key words including communication, hospitalized, nurse, parent, pediatric, and technology-dependent were used to search databases such as Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health and Medline for years 2000-2014. The data regarding the process of parent-nurse communication were extracted as they related to the mutual understanding of optimal care for the child. The data were grouped into themes and compared across studies, designs, populations, and settings. Results Six articles were identified that provided information regarding the processes of shared communication among the parents of hospitalized technology-dependent children and their nurses. Providing clear information, involving parents in care decisions, trust and respect for each other's expertise, caring attitudes, advocacy, and role negotiation were all found to be important factors in shared parent-nurse communication. Linking Evidence to Action The results of this integrative review inform our understanding of the parent-nurse communication process. The findings provide nurses with an understanding of strategies to better engage in respectful, engaging, and intentional communication with parents of hospitalized technology-dependent children and improve patient outcomes."
An Integrative Review of Relationships Between Discrimination and Asian American Health	"Purpose: Many ethnic minorities in the United States experience disproportionate rates of adverse health outcomes or health disparities. Factors such as socioeconomic status do not fully explain how these disparities are generated and maintained. Research has demonstrated that chronic experiences of discrimination are harmful to the health of African Americans and Latinos. However, there is a dearth of research examining Asian Americans' experiences with discrimination and health disparities. The purpose of this integrative review was to summarize the current literature examining discrimination and the mental and physical health of Asian Americans. Design and Methods: Combinations of search terms related to discrimination, health, and Asian Americans were used to search five electronic databases. Inclusion criteria were primary research studies, published in English between 1980 and 2011, Asian American adults, and discrimination examined in relationship to a physical or mental health outcome. The search initially yielded 489 results; 14 quantitative studies met inclusion criteria. Findings and Conclusions: Quantitative studies in this review revealed several significant associations between discrimination and health outcomes in Asian Americans. Discrimination was significantly associated with depressive symptoms in seven studies. Three studies found associations between discrimination and physical health, including cardiovascular disease, respiratory conditions, obesity, and diabetes. Although the literature was limited by self-reported data, cross-sectional designs, and inconsistent definitions and measurement of discrimination, the findings suggest that discrimination is a significant contributor to poorer health and health disparities for Asian Americans. The findings clearly demonstrate the need for further nursing research in this area to inform evidence-based practice and social policy. Clinical Relevance: Patient care providers can recognize discrimination as a significant stressor or purveyor of illness and explore ways to facilitate coping and resilience with their Asian American patients. Community-based participatory research approaches can be implemented by clinicians, academicians, and Asian American community partners to address the issue of discrimination and Asian American health outcomes."
An Integrative Review of the Barriers to Indigenous Peoples Participation in Biobanking and Genomic Research.	"PURPOSE This investigation was undertaken to define the barriers to indigenous peoples participating in biobanking and genomic research. METHODS A literature review was conducted to identify studies reporting on the experience of indigenous peoples with biobanking, tissue banking, and genomic research. Studies pertaining to organ transplantation or blood donation for transfusion were excluded. The databases searched were MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, with all literature available until the search date of June 1, 2018, included. The reference lists of all included papers, as well as related review articles, were manually searched to identify additional relevant studies. An inductive approach was used to identify common themes. RESULTS Seventeen publications discussed the experiences of New Zealand Maori (n = 2), Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (n = 3), Native Hawaiian (n = 4), Native Alaskan (n = 2), American First Nation (n = 2), or multiple ethnicities (n = 4). Across all indigenous peoples, four themes emerged: land, ancestors, culture, and bodily substances are powerfully interconnected and can act on each other; tissue and blood can provide important information (both Western and traditional) about a person; the ownership of specimens - custodians, trustees, or guardians; and the beneficence of the researchers and research team. CONCLUSION Indigenous communities, like Western populations, are concerned with issues pertaining to handling, treatment, and ownership of tissue as well as knowledge gained from specimen analysis. Unlike many Western populations, indigenous communities have retained a strong sense of cultural connection to ancestors and traditional lands and view biologic specimens as inseparable from these things."
An Integrative Review on Development of ÄúQUality Of care Through the patients' EyesÄù (QUOTE) Instruments	"ÄúQUality Of care Through the patients' EyesÄù (QUOTE) instruments for measuring care quality were classified in terms of procedures, structures, and content. The content and structures of each instrument were found to include (a) participation of the client in the tool development process, (b) evaluation of the importance and performance of care based on the client's needs, and (c) reflection of multidimensional care in diverse settings."
An integrative review on family caregivers' involvement in care of home-dwelling elderly.	"Often family members provide care-giving, which allows older adults to remain in their homes. With declining health and increasing frailty, care-giving of elderly people becomes a task of family caregivers (FC) in conjunction with home care nurses. It has been shown in both acute care settings and long-term care facilities that family members prefer to be involved in decision-making and care planning for their next of kin. Therefore, an integrative review was conducted to explore the body of knowledge of FCs' involvement in home-care settings from the FCs' perspective. CINAHL, PubMed, and Cochrane databases was searched with the terms family caregiver, involvement, home care, and community dwelling. Studies written in German or English between 1996 and 2017 focusing on FCs' caring for home-dwelling older adults together with home care nurses were included and critically appraised. The extracted findings were analysed with concept analysis method. Twenty-six studies were included and five themes were identified. Four themes formed the basis of assistance towards family caregivers by nurses and included ""relationship building with professionals,"" ""negotiating with professional care,"" ""being professionally supported,"" and ""managing role expectations and knowledge sharing"". The fifth theme, ""working together"" described the mutual care for the care recipient. Although the first four themes were consistent with a pre-existing conceptual model by Sims-Gould and Marin-Matthews (2010), the fifth required an expansion of the model with an additional contribution ""collaborative practice"". The findings illustrate that involvement in care is an interactional process, which provides the basis for collaborative practices with the home care nurses for family caregivers. Family members often want to be part of the healthcare team, and nurses need contextual factors that allow providing their full range of skills and knowledge to involve family caregivers accordingly."
Antenatal HIV Testing in Sub-Saharan Africa During the Implementation of the Millennium Development Goals: A Systematic Review Using the PEN-3 Cultural Model	"This study systematically explored the barriers and facilitators to routine antenatal HIV testing from the perspective of pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa during the implementation period of the Millennium Development Goals. Articles published between 2000 and 2015 were selected after reviewing the title, abstract, and references. Twenty-seven studies published in 11 African countries were eligible for the current study and reviewed. The most common barriers identified include communication with male partners, patient convenience and accessibility, health system and health-care provider issues, fear of disclosure, HIV-related stigma, the burden of other responsibilities at home, and the perception of antenatal care as a ""woman's job."" Routine testing among pregnant women is crucial for the eradication of infant and child HIV infections. Further understanding the interplay of social and cultural factors, particularly the role of women in intimate relationships and the influence of men on antenatal care seeking behaviors, is necessary to continue the work of the Millennium Development Goals."
Application of discrete choice experiments to enhance stakeholder engagement as a strategy for advancing implementation: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: One of the key strategies to successful implementation of effective health-related interventions is targeting improvements in stakeholder engagement. The discrete choice experiment (DCE) is a stated preference technique for eliciting individual preferences over hypothetical alternative scenarios that is increasingly being used in health-related applications. DCEs are a dynamic approach to systematically measure health preferences which can be applied in enhancing stakeholder engagement. However, a knowledge gap exists in characterizing the extent to which DCEs are used in implementation science. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search (up to December 2016) of the English literature to identify and describe the use of DCEs in engaging stakeholders as an implementation strategy. We searched the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, Econlit, PsychINFO, and the CINAHL using mesh terms. Studies were categorized according to application type, stakeholder(s), healthcare setting, and implementation outcome. RESULTS: Seventy-five publications were selected for analysis in this systematic review. Studies were categorized by application type: (1) characterizing demand for therapies and treatment technologies (n = 32), (2) comparing implementation strategies (n = 22), (3) incentivizing workforce participation (n = 11), and (4) prioritizing interventions (n = 10). Stakeholders included providers (n = 27), patients (n = 25), caregivers (n = 5), and administrators (n = 2). The remaining studies (n = 16) engaged multiple stakeholders (i.e., combination of patients, caregivers, providers, and/or administrators). The following implementation outcomes were discussed: acceptability (n = 75), appropriateness (n = 34), adoption (n = 19), feasibility (n = 16), and fidelity (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: The number of DCE studies engaging stakeholders as an implementation strategy has been increasing over the past decade. As DCEs are more widely used as a healthcare assessment tool, there is a wide range of applications for them in stakeholder engagement. The DCE approach could serve as a tool for engaging stakeholders in implementation science."
"Applications of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health in goal-setting practices in healthcare"	"PURPOSE: While evidence exists to support the adoption of collaborative goal-setting in healthcare, some clinicians feel that it is not feasible. This article proposes that the development of a standardized collaborative goal-setting approach using the framework and classification system of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) could address these feasibility issues. It is the objective of this article to understand the extent to which the ICF has been integrated into current goal-setting literature in order to assess its potential use in a standardized collaborative goal-setting approach. METHODS: A scoping review of the literature published in English since 2001 was conducted in EMBASE, Medline and CINAHL. Articles were included in this review if they integrated the ICF into goal-setting practices in any healthcare discipline. RESULTS: Nineteen articles were included in this review. Analysis of these articles revealed that the ICF has been integrated into goal-setting practices. The benefits associated with this integration suggest that integrating the ICF into goal-setting practices can standardize collaborative goal-setting. CONCLUSION: Evidence from this scoping review supports the use of the ICF in healthcare goal-setting practices because it provides clinicians and patients with specific steps to follow when attempting to set goals collaboratively. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Collaborative goal-setting. Collaborative goal-setting involves patients working with their clinicians to develop health outcome goals together and is a fundamental component of patient-centered care. Some rehabilitation disciplines have yet to fully embrace collaborative goal-setting due to feasibility issues. This article proposes that the integration of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) into goal-setting practices could standardize collaborative goal-setting in a way that would address these feasibility issues."
Are cancer-related decision aids appropriate for socially disadvantaged patients? A systematic review of US randomized controlled trials.	"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making (SDM) is considered a key component of high quality cancer care and may be supported by patient decision aids (PtDAs). Many patients, however, face multiple social disadvantages that may influence their ability to fully participate in SDM or to use PtDAs; additionally, these social disadvantages are among the determinants of health associated with greater cancer risk, unwarranted variations in care and worse outcomes. The purpose of this systematic review is to describe the extent to which disadvantaged social groups in the United States (US) have been included in trials of cancer-related PtDAs and to highlight strategies, lessons learned and future opportunities for developing and evaluating PtDAs that are appropriate for disadvantaged populations. METHODS: We selected cancer-related US studies from the Cochrane 2014 review of PtDAs and added RCTs meeting Cochrane criteria from searches of PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO (January 2010 to December 2013); and reference lists. Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts; three reviewers independently screened full text articles, performed data extraction and assessed: 1) inclusion of participants based on seven indicators of social disadvantage (limited education; female gender; uninsured or Medicaid status; non-U.S. nativity; non-White race or Hispanic ethnicity; limited English proficiency; low-literacy), and 2) attention to social disadvantage in the development or evaluation of PtDAs. RESULTS: Twenty-three of 39 eligible RCTs included participants from at least one disadvantaged subgroup, most frequently racial/ethnic minorities or individuals with limited education and/or low-literacy. Seventeen studies discussed strategies and lessons learned in attending to the needs of disadvantaged social groups in PtDA development; 14 studies targeted disadvantaged groups or addressed subgroup differences in PtDA evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: The diversity of the US population is represented in a majority of cancer-related PtDA RCTs, but fewer studies have tailored PtDAs to address the multiple social disadvantages that may impact patients' participation in SDM. More detailed attention to the comprehensive range of social factors that determine cancer risk, variations in care and outcomes is needed in the development and evaluation of PtDAs for disadvantaged populations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered 24 October 2014 in PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews ( CRD42014014470 )."
Are you still driving? Metasynthesis of patient preferences for communication with health care providers	"AIM: The aim of this study was to synthesize published qualitative studies to identify older adults' preferences for communication about driving with health care providers. BACKGROUND: Health care providers play a key role in addressing driving safety and driving retirement with older adults, but conversations about driving can be difficult. Guides exist for family members and providers, but to date less is known about the types of communication and messages older drivers want from their health care providers. DESIGN: A qualitative metasynthesis of studies published on or before October 10, 2014, in databases (PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) and grey literature was performed. REVIEW METHODS: Twenty-two published studies representing 518 older adult drivers met the following inclusion criteria: the study (1) was about driving; (2) involved older drivers; (3) was qualitative (rather than quantitative or mixed methods); and (4) contained information on older drivers' perspectives about communication with health care providers. RESULTS: We identified 5 major themes regarding older adults' communication preferences: (1) driving discussions are emotionally charged; (2) context matters; (3) providers are trusted and viewed as authority figures; (4) communication should occur over a period of time rather than suddenly; and (5) older adults desire agency in the decision to stop driving. CONCLUSION: Various stakeholders involved in older driver safety should consider older drivers' perspectives regarding discussions about driving. Health care providers can respect and empower older drivers-and support their family members-through tactful communication about driving safety and mobility transitions during the life course."
ART adherence clubs in the Western Cape of South Africa: what does the sustainability framework tell us? A scoping literature review	"INTRODUCTION: In 2007, the antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence club (AC) model was introduced to South Africa to combat some of the health system barriers to ART delivery, such as staff constraints and increasing patient load causing clinic congestion. It aimed to absorb the growing number of stable patients on treatment, ensure quality of care and reduce the workload on healthcare workers. A pilot project of ACs showed improved outcomes for club members with increased retention in care, reduced loss to follow-up and a reduction in viral rebound. In 2011, clubs were rolled out across the Cape Metro District with promising clinical outcomes. This review investigates factors that enable or jeopardize sustainability of the adherence club model in the Western Cape of South Africa. METHODS: A scoping literature review was carried out. Electronic databases, organizations involved in ACs and reference lists of relevant articles were searched. Findings were analysed using a sustainability framework of five key components: (1) Design and implementation processes, (2) Organizational capacity, (3) Community embeddedness, (4) Enabling environment and (5) Context. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The literature search identified 466 articles, of which six were included in the core review. Enablers of sustainability included the collaborative implementation process with collective learning sessions, the programme's flexibility, the high acceptability, patient participation and political support (to some extent). Jeopardizing factors revolved around financial constraints as non-governmental organizations are the main supporters of ACs by providing staff and technical support. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed convincing factors that enable sustainability of ACs in the long term and identified areas for future research. Community embeddedness of clubs with empowerment and participation of patients, is a strong enabler to the sustainability of the model. Further policies are recommended to regulate the role of lay healthcare workers, ensure the reliability of the drug supply and the funding of club activities. Copyright ¬© 2019 The Authors.

Assessing the effectiveness of interventions to support patient decision making about breast reconstruction: A systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Decision making about breast reconstruction (BR) following a diagnosis of breast cancer, Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS), or to reduce future breast cancer risk, is difficult and complex. This paper systematically reviews interventions aiming to support patients facing the option of BR, and assesses their effectiveness in improving a range of patient outcomes. METHODS: Ten databases were searched for articles published up to October 2017 that evaluated interventions to support patient decision making about BR within controlled trials. All included studies were assessed for methodological quality. Descriptive analyses of patient outcomes within included studies were performed. RESULTS: The search yielded 3291 articles. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria resulting in the evaluation of seven distinct interventions (n=1212). Six studies were assessed to be of weak methodological quality, with one of moderate and one of strong quality. Three out of five interventions demonstrated a reduction in decisional conflict (ds=0.26-0.69) and two out of three interventions resulted in reductions in decisional regret (ds=0.27-3.69) at various time points. Treatment choice was altered in two of five studies. There were no changes in patient-reported anxiety levels, whilst the impact on depression was mixed. In all studies which reported on it, improvements in patient satisfaction and involvement in decision making were found. CONCLUSIONS: Few interventions are currently available. Whilst some findings are encouraging, improvements on patient outcomes are mixed. Further research should focus on the development and evaluation of effective interventions.

Assessing the extent to which current clinical research is consistent with patient priorities: a scoping review using a case study in patients on or nearing dialysis.	"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is growing acknowledgement that engaging patients to identify their research priorities is important. Using a case study of patients on or nearing dialysis, we sought to assess the extent to which recently completed and ongoing clinical research was consistent with priorities identified by patients, caregivers, and clinicians. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: Over a 4-year sampling frame (January 2010 to December 2013), we systematically searched the medical literature (top 5 nephrology and top 10 general medicine journals accessed through MEDLINE via Ovid), international randomized controlled trial (RCT) registries, and national government and kidney research funding organizations (Canada, U.S., Australia, and U.K.) for published clinical studies, registered RCTs, and funded clinical studies, respectively. Published clinical studies, registered RCTs, and funded clinical studies were categorized as to whether or not they were consistent with the top 10 research priorities identified by patients, their caregivers, and clinicians in a recent comprehensive research priority setting exercise. FINDINGS: The search yielded 4293 published articles, 688 RCTs, and 70 funded studies, of which 1116 articles, 315 RCTs, and 70 funded studies were eligible for inclusion. Overall 194 published studies (17.4 %), 71 RCTs (22.5 %), and 15 funded studies (21.4 %) included topics consistent with the top 10 research priorities identified by patients. Four of the top 10 research priorities, including strategies to improve the management of itching, increase access to kidney transplantation, assess the psychosocial impact of kidney failure, and determine the effects of dietary restriction received virtually no attention. LIMITATIONS: The top 10 priorities we used to categorize included studies were identified by Canadian patients, caregivers, and clinicians. The top research priorities may vary across different countries. The proportion of published studies that are consistent with the top 10 priorities could be different in nephrology journals with lower impact factors. Studies related to kidney transplantation and the psychosocial impact of kidney failure may have been published in journals not included in our search strategy. IMPLICATIONS: The majority of recently completed or ongoing clinical studies in patients on or nearing dialysis do not address the top research priorities of patients, raising concerns that current clinical research may not be meeting the needs of the ultimate consumer, in this case, patients on or nearing dialysis. Greater involvement of patients in research is required to bridge the gap between research and patients' needs.; Publisher: Il apparait de plus en plus important de consulter les patients afin de mieux repondre a leurs attentes vis-a-vis de la recherche clinique. Lors d'une etude de cas faite sur des patients en dialyse ou sur le point d'en entreprendre une, nous avons voulu savoir a quel point les etudes cliniques en cours ou completees recemment etaient en accord avec les priorites de recherche etablies par les patients, le personnel soignant et le personnel clinique.; Language: French"
Assessing the influence of researcher-partner involvement on the process and outcomes of participatory research in autism spectrum disorder and neurodevelopmental disorders: a scoping review	"Participatory research aims to increase the relevance and broaden the implementation of health research by involving those affected by the outcomes of health studies. Few studies within the field of neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly autism spectrum disorders, have involved autistic individuals as partners. This study sought to identify and characterize published participatory research partnerships between researchers and individuals with autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders and examine the influence of participatory research partnerships on the research process and reported study outcomes. A search of databases and review of gray literature identified seven studies that described participatory research partnerships between academic researchers and individuals with autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders. A comparative analysis of the studies revealed two key themes: (1) variations in the participatory research design and (2) limitations during the reporting of the depth of the partner's involvement. Both themes potentially limit the application and generalizability of the findings. The results of the review are discussed in relation to the use of evaluative frameworks for such participatory research studies to determine the potential benefits of participatory research partnerships within the neurodevelopmental and autism spectrum disorder populations.

Assessment of patient empowerment--a systematic review of measures	"BACKGROUND: Patient empowerment has gained considerable importance but uncertainty remains about the best way to define and measure it. The validity of empirical findings depends on the quality of measures used. This systematic review aims to provide an overview of studies assessing psychometric properties of questionnaires purporting to capture patient empowerment, evaluate the methodological quality of these studies and assess the psychometric properties of measures identified. METHODS: Electronic searches in five databases were combined with reference tracking of included articles. Peer-reviewed articles reporting psychometric testing of empowerment measures for adult patients in French, German, English, Portuguese and Spanish were included. Study characteristics, constructs operationalised and psychometric properties were extracted. The quality of study design, methods and reporting was assessed using the COSMIN checklist. The quality of psychometric properties was assessed using Terwee's 2007 criteria. FINDINGS: 30 studies on 19 measures were included. Six measures are generic, while 13 were developed for a specific condition (N=4) or specialty (N=9). Most studies tested measures in English (N=17) or Swedish (N=6). Sample sizes of included studies varied from N=35 to N=8261. A range of patient empowerment constructs was operationalised in included measures. These were classified into four domains: patient states, experiences and capacities; patient actions and behaviours; patient self-determination within the healthcare relationship and patient skills development. Quality assessment revealed several flaws in methodological study quality with COSMIN scores mainly fair or poor. The overall quality of psychometric properties of included measures was intermediate to positive. Certain psychometric properties were not tested for most measures. DISCUSSION: Findings provide a basis from which to develop consensus on a core set of patient empowerment constructs and for further work to develop a (set of) appropriately validated measure(s) to capture this. The methodological quality of psychometric studies could be improved by adhering to published quality criteria."
Assessment of the effects of decision aids about breast cancer screening: a systematic review and meta-analysis	"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies is to assess the effect of decision aids (DAs) in women aged 50 and below facing the decision to be screened for breast cancer. SETTING: Screening for breast cancer. INTERVENTION: DAs aimed to help women make a deliberative choice regarding participation in mammography screening by providing information on the options and outcomes. ELIGIBLE STUDIES: We included published original, non-pilot, studies that assess the effect of DAs for breast cancer screening. We excluded the studies that evaluated only participation intention or actual uptake. The studies' risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for RCTs and the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for non-RCTs. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: The main outcome measures were informed choice, decisional conflict and/or confidence, and knowledge. Secondary outcomes were values, attitudes, uncertainty and intention to be screened. RESULTS: A total of 607 studies were identified, but only 3 RCTs and 1 before-after study were selected. The use of DAs increased the proportion of women making an informed decision by 14%, 95% CI (2% to 27%) and the proportion of women with adequate knowledge by 12%, 95% CI (7% to 16%). We observed heterogeneity among the studies in confidence in the decision. The meta-analysis of the RCTs showed a significant decrease in confidence in the decision and in intention to be screened. CONCLUSIONS: Tools to aid decision making in screening for breast cancer improve knowledge and promote informed decision; however, we found divergent results on decisional conflict and confidence in the decision. Under the current paradigm change, which favours informed choice rather than maximising uptake, more research is necessary for the improvement of DAs.

Assessment of youth-friendly health care: a systematic review of indicators drawn from young people's perspectives	"PURPOSE: To review the literature on young people's perspectives on health care with a view to defining domains and indicators of youth-friendly care. METHODS: Three bibliographic databases were searched to identify studies that purportedly measured young people's perspectives on health care. Each study was assessed to identify the constructs, domains, and indicators of adolescent-friendly health care. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were identified: 15 used quantitative methods, six used qualitative methods and one used mixed methodology. Eight domains stood out as central to young people's positive experience of care. These were: accessibility of health care; staff attitude; communication; medical competency; guideline-driven care; age appropriate environments; youth involvement in health care; and health outcomes. Staff attitudes, which included notions of respect and friendliness, appeared universally applicable, whereas other domains, such as an appropriate environment including cleanliness, were more specific to particular contexts. CONCLUSION: These eight domains provide a practical framework for assessing how well services are engaging young people. Measures of youth-friendly health care should address universally applicable indicators of youth-friendly care and may benefit from additional questions that are specific to the local health setting.

Assuming ability of youth with autism: Synthesis of methods capturing the first-person perspectives of children and youth with disabilities.	"Most research regarding youth with autism spectrum disorder has not focused on their first-person perspectives providing limited insight into methodologies best suited to eliciting their voices. We conducted a synthesis of methods previously used to obtain the first-person perspectives of youth with various disabilities, which may be applicable to youth with autism spectrum disorder. Two-hundred and eighty-four articles met the inclusion criteria of our scoping review. We identified six distinct primary methods (questionnaires, interviews, group discussion, narratives, diaries, and art) expressed through four communication output modalities (language, sign language and gestures, writing, and images). A group of parents who have children with autism spectrum disorder were then presented with a synthesis of results. This parent consultation was used to build on approaches identified in the literature. Parents identified barriers that may be encountered during participant engagement and provided insights on how best to conduct first-person research with youth with autism spectrum disorder. Based on our findings, we present a novel methodological framework to capture the perspectives of youth with various communication and cognitive abilities, while highlighting family, youth, and expert contributions."
Asthma education for school staff.	"Background Teachers and school staff should be competent in managing asthma in schools. Demonstrated low levels of asthma knowledge mean that staff may not know how best to protect a child with asthma in their care, or may fail to take appropriate action in the event of a serious attack. Education about asthma could help to improve this knowledge and lead to better asthma outcomes for children. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of asthma education programmes for school staff, and to identify content and attributes underpinning them. Search methods We conducted the most recent searches on 29 November 2016. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing an intervention to educate school staff about asthma versus a control group. We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only and unpublished data. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors screened the searches, extracted outcome data and intervention characteristics from included studies and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes for the quantitative synthesis were emergency department (ED) or hospital visits, mortality and asthma control; we graded the main results and presented evidence in a 'Summary of findings' table. We planned a qualitative synthesis of intervention characteristics, but study authors were unable to provide the necessary information. Main results Five cluster-RCTs of 111 schools met the review eligibility criteria. Investigators measured outcomes in participating staff and often in children or parents, most often at between 1 and 12 months. Authors' conclusions Asthma education for school staff increases asthma knowledge and preparedness, but studies vary and all available evidence is of low quality. Studies have not yet captured whether this improvement in knowledge has led to appreciable benefits over the short term or the longer term for the safety and health of children with asthma in school. Randomised evidence does not contribute to our knowledge of content or attributes of interventions that lead to the best outcomes, or of resources required for successful implementation."
At the cross-roads of participatory research and biomarker discovery in autism: the need for empirical data	"BACKGROUND: Identifying biomarkers for autism can improve outcomes for those affected by autism. Engaging the diverse stakeholders in the research process using community-based participatory research (CBPR) can accelerate biomarker discovery into clinical applications. However, there are limited examples of stakeholder involvement in autism research, possibly due to conceptual and practical concerns. We evaluate the applicability of CBPR principles to biomarker discovery in autism and critically review empirical studies adopting these principles. METHODS: Using a scoping review methodology, we identified and evaluated seven studies using CBPR principles in biomarker discovery. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The limited number of studies in biomarker discovery adopting CBPR principles coupled with their methodological limitations suggests that such applications are feasible but challenging. These studies illustrate three CBPR themes: community assessment, setting global priorities, and collaboration in research design. We propose that further research using participatory principles would be useful in accelerating the pace of discovery and the development of clinically meaningful biomarkers. For this goal to be successful we advocate for increased attention to previously identified conceptual and methodological challenges to participatory approaches in health research, including improving scientific rigor and developing long-term partnerships among stakeholders."
Availability of patient decision aids for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: A systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is a common irregular heart rhythm that increases patients' risk of stroke. Aspirin, warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants, and an implantable device can reduce this risk. Given the availability of multiple comparable options, this decision depends on patient preferences and is appropriate for the use of decision aids and other efforts to promote shared decision making. The objective of this review was to examine the existence and accessibility of, as well as select outcomes associated with, published, formally evaluated patient decision aids for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. METHODS: Six databases were searched from inception to March 2016 with a research librarian. Two authors independently reviewed potential articles, selected trials meeting inclusion criteria, and assessed outcome measures. Outcomes included patient knowledge, involvement, choice, and decisional conflict. RESULTS: The search resulted in 666 articles; most were excluded for not examining stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and 7 studies were eventually included. Six decision aids displayed combinations of aspirin, warfarin, or no therapy; 1 included a direct oral anticoagulant. Interventions were associated with increased patient knowledge, increased likelihood of making a choice, and low decisional conflict. Use of decision aids in this review was associated with less selection of warfarin. None of the tested decision aids are currently available. DISCUSSION: Published patient decision aids for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation are not accessible for clinical use. Given the availability of multiple comparable options, there is a need to develop and test new patient decision aids in this context. Copyright ¬© 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Balancing Between Privacy and Patient Needs for Health Information in the Age of Participatory Health and Social Media: A Scoping Review.	"OBJECTIVES: With the increased use of participatory health enabling technologies, such as social media, balancing the need for health information with patient privacy and confidentiality has become a more complex and immediate concern. The purpose of this paper produced by the members of the IMIA Participatory Health and Social Media (PHSM) working group is to investigate patient needs for health information using participatory health enabling technologies, while balancing their needs for privacy and confidentiality. METHODS: Six domain areas including media sharing platforms, patient portals, web-based platforms, crowdsourcing websites, medical avatars, and other mobile health technologies were identified by five members of the IMIA PHSM working group as relevant to participatory health and the balance between data sharing and patient needs for privacy and confidentiality. After identifying the relevant domain areas, our scoping review began by searching several databases such as PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar using a variety of key search terms. RESULTS: A total of 1,973 studies were identified, of which 68 studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Results showed that challenges for balancing patient needs for information and privacy and confidentiality concerns included: cross-cultural understanding, clinician and patient awareness, de-identification of data, and commercialization of patient data. Some opportunities identified were patient empowerment, connecting participatory health enabling technologies with clinical records, open data sharing agreement, and e-consent. CONCLUSION: Balancing between privacy and patient needs for health information in the age of participatory health and social media offers several opportunities and challenges. More people are engaging in actively managing health through participatory health enabling technologies. Such activity often includes sharing health information and with this comes a perennial tension between balancing individual needs and the desire to uphold privacy and confidentiality. We recommend that guidelines for both patients and clinicians, in terms of their use of participatory health-enabling technologies, are developed to ensure that patient privacy and confidentiality are protected, and a maximum benefit can be realized.

Barriers and facilitators associated with attendance at hospital diabetes clinics among young adults (15-30 years) with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review	"Regular clinic attendance is recommended to facilitate self-management of diabetes. Poor attendance is common among young adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). This systematic review aimed to produce a narrative synthesis of the evidence regarding factors which promote or impede regular attendance at adult diabetes clinics among young adults (15-30 years) with type 1 DM. Studies reporting facilitators and barriers to clinic attendance were identified by searching four electronic databases, checking reference lists, and contacting diabetes research networks. A total of 12 studies (8 quantitative and 4 qualitative) met the inclusion criteria. Young adult's experiences transitioning from paediatric to adult diabetes care can influence attendance at the adult clinic positively if there is a comprehensive transition programme in place, or negatively if the two clinics do not communicate and provide adequate support. Post-transition, relationship development and perceptions of the value of attending the clinic are important for regular attendance. Controlled research is required to better understand decisions to attend or not attend outpatient services among people with chronic conditions. Service delivery must be sensitive to the developmental characteristics of young adults and tailored support may be required by young adults at greatest risk of non-attendance.

Barriers and facilitators of effective self-management in asthma: systematic review and thematic synthesis of patient and healthcare professional views	"Self-management is an established, effective approach to controlling asthma, recommended in guidelines. However, promotion, uptake and use among patients and health-care professionals remain low. Many barriers and facilitators to effective self-management have been reported, and views and beliefs of patients and health care professionals have been explored in qualitative studies. We conducted a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative research into self-management in patients, carers and health care professionals regarding self-management of asthma, to identify perceived barriers and facilitators associated with reduced effectiveness of asthma self-management interventions. Electronic databases and guidelines were searched systematically for qualitative literature that explored factors relevant to facilitators and barriers to uptake, adherence, or outcomes of self-management in patients with asthma. Thematic synthesis of the 56 included studies identified 11 themes: (1) partnership between patient and health care professional; (2) issues around medication; (3) education about asthma and its management; (4) health beliefs; (5) self-management interventions; (6) co-morbidities (7) mood disorders and anxiety; (8) social support; (9) non-pharmacological methods; (10) access to healthcare; (11) professional factors. From this, perceived barriers and facilitators were identified at the level of individuals with asthma (and carers), and health-care professionals. Future work addressing the concerns and beliefs of adults, adolescents and children (and carers) with asthma, effective communication and partnership, tailored support and education (including for ethnic minorities and at risk groups), and telehealthcare may improve how self-management is recommended by professionals and used by patients. Ultimately, this may achieve better outcomes for people with asthma."
Barriers and facilitators of exercise experienced by cancer survivors: a mixed methods systematic review.	"PURPOSE: Exercise has been shown to improve the health and well-being of people who have survived cancer. Yet, less than 40% of cancer survivors in Australia meet the recommended 150 min of moderate-intensity physical activity per week. Our objective was to systematically review the literature regarding barriers, facilitators and preferences for exercise for survivors of cancer. METHOD: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Scopus were searched for qualitative and quantitative articles addressing barriers, facilitators and preferences for exercise in cancer survivors. Quality assessment was performed by two independent reviewers using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Thomas and Harden's method of thematic synthesis was used to amalgamate qualitative data while descriptive statistics were used to collate quantitative data. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included (9 qualitative and 10 quantitative). Persisting treatment-related side effects was the most commonly reported barrier to initiating or maintaining exercise, followed by lack of time and fatigue. The most common facilitators of exercise were gaining a feeling of control over their health as well as managing emotions and mental well-being, while the preferred method of exercise was walking. We also identified a lack of useful information provided to survivors regarding exercise. CONCLUSION: Treatment-related side effects, lack of time and fatigue were key barriers to exercise for survivors of varied cancer types. Insufficient patient education may contribute to the belief that exercise is not helpful when experiencing side effects of treatment, including fatigue. Identifying barriers and facilitators leads to improved support and education from health professionals which is required to provide safe and effective exercise recommendations for survivors."
Barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination of young women in high-income countries: a qualitative systematic review and evidence synthesis	"BACKGROUND: Vaccination against Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended for adolescent young women prior to sexual debut to reduce cervical cancer related mortality and morbidity. Understanding factors affecting decision-making of HPV vaccination of young women is important so that effective interventions can be developed which address barriers to uptake in population groups less likely to receive the HPV vaccine. METHODS: We undertook a qualitative systematic review and evidence synthesis to examine decision-making relating to the HPV vaccination of young women in high-income countries. A comprehensive search of databases from inception to March 2012 was undertaken to identify eligible studies reporting the perspectives of key stakeholders including policy makers, professionals involved in programme, parents, and young women. Factors affecting uptake of the vaccine were examined at different levels of the socio-ecological model (policy, community, organisational, interpersonal and intrapersonal). RESULTS: Forty-one studies were included. Whether young women receive the HPV vaccine is strongly governed by the decisions of policy makers, healthcare professionals, and parents. These decisions are shaped by: financial considerations; social norms and values relating to sexual activity, and; trust in vaccination programmes and healthcare providers. Financial constraints may be overcome through universal healthcare systems offering the HPV vaccine free at the point of delivery. In the healthcare setting, judgements by healthcare professionals about whether to recommend the vaccine may restrict a young woman's access to the vaccine irrespective of her own beliefs and preferences. Parents may decide not to allow their daughters to be vaccinated, based on cultural or religious perceptions about sexual activity. CONCLUSIONS: Barriers to the uptake of the HPV vaccine have implications for young women's future sexual, physical and reproductive health. Interventions to address barriers to uptake of the vaccine should target appropriate, and multiple, levels of the socio-ecological model. Issues of trust require clear, accessible, and sometimes culturally appropriate, information about the HPV vaccination programme. Although young women are central to the HPV vaccination programme, their views are underrepresented in the qualitative literature. Future research should consider young women's perceptions of, and involvement in, consent and decision-making."
Barriers and facilitators to implementing family support and education in Early Psychosis Intervention programmes: A systematic review.	"Family support is a core component of the Early Psychosis Intervention (EPI) model, yet it continues to have relatively low rates of implementation in practice. This paper reports results of a literature review on facilitators and barriers to delivering family interventions in EPI programmes. A search was conducted of 4 electronic databases, Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Joanna Briggs, from 2000 to 2015 using terms related to early onset psychosis, family work and implementation. Four thousand four hundred and two unique studies were identified, 7 of which met inclusion criteria. Barriers and facilitators were coded and aggregated to higher-level themes using a consensus approach. Five of 7 studies examined structured multifamily psychoeducation. Uptake by families was affected by: family/client interest and readiness to participate; ability to access supports; and support needs/preferences. Implementation by programmes was affected by staff access to training and resources to provide family support. A key finding across the identified studies was that families have different needs and preferences regarding the timing, length, intensity and content of the intervention. One size does not fit all and many families do not require the intensive psychoeducational programmes typically provided. The reviewed literature suggests that flexible, tiered approaches to care may better meet family needs and increase rates of uptake of family support. However, more research is needed on the effectiveness of different models of family support in early psychosis and how they can be successfully implemented."
Barriers and facilitators to shared decision-making in oncology: a systematic review of the literature	"PURPOSE: Shared decision-making (SDM) is a strategy to facilitate patient-centered care and is increasingly important in oncology, where patients are faced with complicated treatment decisions that require them to weigh efficacy and safety, quality of life, and cost. Understanding the contributors to the use of SDM may provide insight to its further implementation. Therefore, the objective of the study was to examine the patient-related barriers/facilitators to SDM in oncology care. METHODS: A systematic literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was executed. A search strategy composed of cancer, decision-making, and patient-centered terms was conducted utilizing PubMed, EBSCO MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library databases between January 2007 and November 2017. Full-text, US-based, English language articles describing the patient perspective of SDM in oncology care were included. Relevant data from articles were reviewed in a qualitative synthesis. RESULTS: From 3435 potential citations, a total of 35 articles were included. The most common cancers studied were breast (n = 22; 62.9%) and prostate (n = 9; 25.7%). The identified themes for barriers to SDM were uncertainty in the treatment decision, concern regarding adverse effects, and poor physician communication. Themes for facilitators for SDM included physician consideration of patient preferences, positive physician actions and behaviors, and use or encouragement of support systems. CONCLUSION: As SDM gains use within oncology practice, understanding key influences will allow for more effective implementation of strategies to increase patient engagement and improve care and value in the treatment process."
Barriers and facilitators towards fertility preservation care for cancer patients: a meta-synthesis	"Infertility is a potential late-effect of cancer treatment, which negatively impact on young cancer survivors' quality of life. This paper aims to synthesise factors that influence patients', carers' and healthcare professionals' decision to engage in fertility preservation programmes at the time of cancer diagnosis. Four databases and grey literature were systematically searched to identify qualitative and mixed-method studies published between 2000 and 2015. Thematic framework and synthesis were used to analyse and synthesise the data. Thirty-seven papers were selected and represented. Factors that affect engagement of patients, carers and healthcare providers in fertility preservation care can be grouped as intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic factors include patients' attitudes, health beliefs and health literacy; clinicians' approaches and skills; as well as doctor-patient relationships. Extrinsic factors include fertility preservation care resources and institutional characteristics. We conclude that existing qualitative literature highlights the complex convergences of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that impede successful engagement in fertility preservation care. Addressing these factors could help cancer survivors achieve better health outcomes and improve their wellbeing. Potential solutions include attitudinal changes and organisational skill reforms across the health community that will help ensure a person's goals are always at the centre of their cancer care.

Barriers of enrolment in HIV vaccine trials: a review of HIV vaccine preparedness studies	"Barriers to participation in an HIV vaccine trial have been examined in many HIV vaccine preparedness studies (VPS). These barriers can be understood in terms of the locus of the barrier (personal vs. social) and the nature of the barrier (risk vs. cost). Another type of barrier is perceived misconceptions. In this systematic review, we categorize barriers, and compare these barriers between the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and the non-OECD countries. In the OECD countries, we retrieved 25 studies reporting personal risks (PR), 9 studies reporting social risks (SR), 10 studies reporting personal costs (PC), and 16 studies reporting misconceptions. In the non-OECD countries, we retrieved 27 studies reporting PR, 19 studies reporting SR, 18 studies reporting PC, 1 study reporting social costs (SC), and 13 studies reporting misconceptions. Important PR were ""adverse effects"" and ""vaccine-induced seropositivity"", ""distrust of institutions"", and ""temptation to have unsafe sex"" in men who have sex with men (MSM). ""Discrimination"" was a common SR. ""Time commitment"" was an important PC, and ""family commitments"" were a SC in one non-OECD country. ""HIV infection from the vaccine"" was a common misconception. Both the OECD and the non-OECD countries have similar barriers, and people's decisions to participate in a clinical trial involve multiple barriers. However, these barriers apply to hypothetical HIV vaccine trials, and barriers for actual vaccine trials need further assessment. Copyright ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Barriers to and Facilitators of Engagement With Remote Measurement Technology for Managing Health: Systematic Review and Content Analysis of Findings	"BACKGROUND: Remote measurement technology refers to the use of mobile health technology to track and measure change in health status in real time as part of a person's everyday life. With accurate measurement, remote measurement technology offers the opportunity to augment health care by providing personalized, precise, and preemptive interventions that support insight into patterns of health-related behavior and self-management. However, for successful implementation, users need to be engaged in its use. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to systematically review the literature to update and extend the understanding of the key barriers to and facilitators of engagement with and use of remote measurement technology, to guide the development of future remote measurement technology resources. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines involving original studies dating back to the last systematic review published in 2014. We included studies if they met the following entry criteria: population (people using remote measurement technology approaches to aid management of health), intervention (remote measurement technology system), comparison group (no comparison group specified), outcomes (qualitative or quantitative evaluation of the barriers to and facilitators of engagement with this system), and study design (randomized controlled trials, feasibility studies, and observational studies). We searched 5 databases (MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) for articles published from January 2014 to May 2017. Articles were independently screened by 2 researchers. We extracted study characteristics and conducted a content analysis to define emerging themes to synthesize findings. Formal quality assessments were performed to address risk of bias. RESULTS: A total of 33 studies met inclusion criteria, employing quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods designs. Studies were conducted in 10 countries, included male and female participants, with ages ranging from 8 to 95 years, and included both active and passive remote monitoring systems for a diverse range of physical and mental health conditions. However, they were relatively short and had small sample sizes, and reporting of usage statistics was inconsistent. Acceptability of remote measurement technology according to the average percentage of time used (64%-86.5%) and dropout rates (0%-44%) was variable. The barriers and facilitators from the content analysis related to health status, perceived utility and value, motivation, convenience and accessibility, and usability. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review highlight gaps in the design of studies trialing remote measurement technology, including the use of quantitative assessment of usage and acceptability. Several processes that could facilitate engagement with this technology have been identified and may drive the development of more person-focused remote measurement technology. However, these factors need further testing through carefully designed experimental studies.

"Barriers to, and facilitators of, parenting programmes for childhood behaviour problems: A qualitative synthesis of studies of parents' and professionals' perceptions."	"Disruptive behaviour problems (DBPs) during childhood exert a high burden on individuals, families and the community as a whole. Reducing this impact is a major public health priority. Early parenting interventions are recommended as valuable ways to target DBPs; however, low take-up of, and high drop-out rates from, these programmes seriously reduce their effectiveness. We present a review of published qualitative evidence relating to factors that block or facilitate access and engagement of parents with such programmes using a thematic synthesis approach. 12 papers presenting views of both parents and professionals met our inclusion and quality criteria. A large number of barriers were identified highlighting the array of challenges parents can face when considering accessing and engaging with treatment for their child with behavioural problems. Facilitating factors in this area were also identified. A series of recommendations were made with regard to raising awareness of programmes and recruiting parents, providing flexible and individually tailored support, delivering programmes through highly skilled, trained and knowledgeable therapists, and highlighting factors to consider when delivering group-based programmes. Clinical guidelines should address barriers and facilitators of engagement as well as basic efficacy of treatment approaches. ¬© The Author(s) 2013."
Best practice framework for Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) in collaborative data analysis of qualitative mental health research: Methodology development and refinement.	"Background: Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) in mental health research is increasing, especially in early (pre-funding) stages. PPI is less consistent in later stages, including in analysing qualitative data. The aims of this study were to develop a methodology for involving PPI co-researchers in collaboratively analysing qualitative mental health research data with academic researchers, to pilot and refine this methodology, and to create a best practice framework for collaborative data analysis (CDA) of qualitative mental health research."
Best Practices for the Prevention and Management of Diabetes and Obesity-Related Chronic Disease among Indigenous Peoples in Canada: A Review	"OBJECTIVES: To carry out a systematic review of interventions that have aimed at improving screening, treatment, prevention and management of type 2 diabetes and obesity-related chronic disease in Indigenous communities in Canada from 2008 to 2014, with the aim of identifying current best practices. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was carried out through an electronic database search using Medline, EMBASE, PubMED and Google scholar. RESULTS: We identified 17 publications, comprising 13 evaluated interventions. Of them, 7 were school-based programs focused on children, 5 focused on adults, and 1 included both adults and children. Most interventions aimed at encouraging behaviour change, especially dietary change, but did little to address the underlying context of systemic marginalization and colonialism experienced in many Indigenous communities. Interventions focused on improving fitness were more effective than those aimed at dietary change. Overall, we found a range of successes among these interventions. Those that met with limited success reported that complex social issues and poverty presented challenges to effective intervention work in these communities. Participatory action research methods and community ownership of the intervention were found to be essential for project success. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes-focused intervention research in Indigenous communities appears to be a low priority for Canadian funders and policymakers. More intervention research is urgently needed in these communities. To be effective, this work must take an approach that is historically deep and sufficiently broad as to enable the ideologic, policy and institutional changes necessary in order to achieve true equity. This will involve addressing colonialism, racism and social exclusion as broader determinants of health. Copyright ¬© 2015 Canadian Diabetes Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Beyond Dr. Google: the evidence on consumer-facing digital tools for diagnosis	"Over a third of adults go online to diagnose their health condition. Direct-to-consumer (DTC), interactive, diagnostic apps with information personalization capabilities beyond those of static search engines are rapidly proliferating. While these apps promise faster, more convenient and more accurate information to improve diagnosis, little is known about the state of the evidence on their performance or the methods used to evaluate them. We conducted a scoping review of the peer-reviewed and gray literature for the period January 1, 2014-June 30, 2017. We found that the largest category of evaluations involved symptom checkers that applied algorithms to user-answered questions, followed by sensor-driven apps that applied algorithms to smartphone photos, with a handful of evaluations examining crowdsourcing. The most common clinical areas evaluated were dermatology and general diagnostic and triage advice for a range of conditions. Evaluations were highly variable in methodology and conclusions, with about half describing app characteristics and half examining actual performance. Apps were found to vary widely in functionality, accuracy, safety and effectiveness, although the usefulness of this evidence was limited by a frequent failure to provide results by named individual app. Overall, the current evidence base on DTC, interactive diagnostic apps is sparse in scope, uneven in the information provided and inconclusive with respect to safety and effectiveness, with no studies of clinical risks and benefits involving real-world consumer use. Given that DTC diagnostic apps are rapidly evolving, rigorous and standardized evaluations are essential to inform decisions by clinicians, patients, policymakers and other stakeholders."
"Beyond the black box: a systematic review of breast, prostate, colorectal, and cervical screening among native and immigrant African-descent Caribbean populations"	"Cancer screening disparities between black and white groupings are well-documented. Less is known regarding African-descent subpopulations despite elevated risk, distinct cultural backgrounds, and increasing numbers of Caribbean migrants. A systematic search of Medline, Web of Science, PubMed and SCOPUS databases (1980-2012) identified 53 studies reporting rates of breast, prostate, cervical, and colorectal screening behavior among immigrant and non-immigrant Caribbean groups. Few studies were conducted within the Caribbean itself; most work is US-based, and the majority stem from Brooklyn, New York. In general, African-descent Caribbean populations screen for breast, prostate, colorectal, and cervical cancers less frequently than US-born African-Americans and at lower rates than recommendations and guidelines. Haitian immigrants, in particular, screen at very low frequencies. Both immigrant and non-immigrant African-descent Caribbean groups participate in screening less frequently than recommended. Studying screening among specific Caribbean groups of African-descent may yield data that both clarifies health disparities between US-born African-Americans and whites and illuminates the specific subpopulations at risk in these growing immigrant communities."
Biopsychosocial-spiritual factors impacting referral to and participation in cardiac rehabilitation for African American patients: A systematic review.	"PURPOSE: The purposes of this systematic review were to (1) review the literature related to the demographic and biopsychosocial-spiritual factors impacting cardiac rehabilitation (CR) referral and participation of African American patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD); (2) identify barriers and facilitators to CR referral and participation for this population; (3) identify gaps in the literature; and (4) make recommendations for future research studies and interventions. METHODS: The Cooper 7-step protocol for research synthesis was followed to formulate a research question and search MEDLINE via PubMed, PsycINFO via EBSCO, and CINAHL via EBSCO. A second reviewer repeated the searches performed by the first author in the initial review. RESULTS: A total of 1640 articles identified using the search strategy yielded 7 articles that fit the search criteria. Most studies measured demographic or social factors. Two studies measured biological factors, 1 study measured psychological factors, and no study measured spiritual factors. CONCLUSIONS: According to the studies reviewed, African American patients with CVD were less likely to receive a CR referral, more likely to enroll in CR with more cardiovascular risk factors, and less likely to participate in and complete CR due to factors related to low socioeconomic status (eg, lack of insurance, work conflicts, lower level of education) than non-Hispanic white patients. Further research is needed on the interaction between demographic/biopsychosocial-spiritual factors and referral to and participation of African Americans in CR in order to ensure that interventions fit the needs of this particular population."
Black and minority ethnic group involvement in health and social care research: A systematic review.	"BACKGROUND: Patient and public involvement (PPI) in research is growing internationally, but little is known about black and minority ethnic (BME) involvement and the factors influencing their involvement in health and social care research. OBJECTIVES: To characterize and critique the empirical literature on BME-PPI involvement in health and social care research. SEARCH STRATEGY: Systematic searches of six electronic bibliographic databases were undertaken, utilizing both MeSH and free-text terms to identify international empirical literature published between 1990 and 2016. INCLUSION CRITERIA: All study designs that report primary data that involved BME groups in health or social care research. Screening was conducted by two reviewers. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data extraction and quality appraisal were performed independently. Data extraction focused on the level(s) of PPI involvement and where PPI activity occurred in the research cycle. Studies were quality-assessed using the guidelines for measuring the quality and impact of user involvement in research. Data were analysed using a narrative approach. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-five studies were included with the majority undertaken in the USA focusing on African Americans and indigenous populations. Involvement most commonly occurred during the research design phase and least in data analysis and interpretation. CONCLUSION: This is the first systematic review investigating BME involvement in health and social care research internationally. While there is a widespread support for BME involvement, this is limited to particular phases of the research and particular ethnic subgroups. There is a need to understand factors that influence BME involvement in all parts of the research cycle. Copyright ¬© 2017 The Authors Health Expectations Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Can Consumer-Led Mental Health Services be Equally Effective? An Integrative Review of CLMH Services in High-Income Countries	"This study examined the evidence from controlled studies for the effectiveness of consumer-led mental health services. Following an extensive search of material published in English from 1980, predefined inclusion criteria were systematically applied to research articles that compared a consumer-led mental health service to a traditional mental health service. A total of 29 eligible studies were appraised; all of them were conducted in high-income countries. Overall consumer-led services reported equally positive outcomes for their clients as traditional services, particularly for practical outcomes such as employment or living arrangements, and in reducing hospitalizations and thus the cost of services. Involving consumers in service delivery appears to provide employment opportunities and be beneficial overall for the consumer-staff members and the service. Despite growing evidence of effectiveness, barriers such as underfunding continue to limit the use and evaluation of consumer-led services. Future studies need to adopt more uniform definitions and prioritize the inclusion of recovery oriented outcome measures."
Canadian Guidelines for Controlled Pediatric Donation After Circulatory Determination of Death-Summary Report.	"OBJECTIVES: Create trustworthy, rigorous, national clinical practice guidelines for the practice of pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death in Canada. METHODS: We followed a process of clinical practice guideline development based on World Health Organization and Canadian Medical Association methods. This included application of Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. Questions requiring recommendations were generated based on 1) 2006 Canadian donation after circulatory determination of death guidelines (not pediatric specific), 2) a multidisciplinary symposium of national and international pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death leaders, and 3) a scoping review of the pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death literature. Input from these sources drove drafting of actionable questions and Good Practice Statements, as defined by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation group. We performed additional literature reviews for all actionable questions. Evidence was assessed for quality using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation and then formulated into evidence profiles that informed recommendations through the evidence-to-decision framework. Recommendations were revised through consensus among members of seven topic-specific working groups and finalized during meetings of working group leads and the planning committee. External review was provided by pediatric, critical care, and critical care nursing professional societies and patient partners. RESULTS: We generated 63 Good Practice Statements and seven Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation recommendations covering 1) ethics, consent, and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy, 2) eligibility, 3) withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy practices, 4) ante and postmortem interventions, 5) death determination, 6) neonatal pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death, 7) cardiac and innovative pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death, and 8) implementation. For brevity, 48 Good Practice Statement and truncated justification are included in this summary report. The remaining recommendations, detailed methodology, full Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tables, and expanded justifications are available in the full text report. CONCLUSIONS: This process showed that rigorous, transparent clinical practice guideline development is possible in the domain of pediatric deceased donation. Application of these recommendations will increase access to pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death across Canada and may serve as a model for future clinical practice guideline development in deceased donation."
Canadian Schizophrenia Guidelines: Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders with Coexisting Substance Use Disorders.	"Objective: Persons with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders frequently have coexisting substance use disorders that require modifications to treatment approaches for best outcomes. The objectives of this review were to identify evidence-based practices best practices that improve outcomes for individuals with schizophrenia and substance used disorders. Method: We reviewed guidelines that were published in the last 5 years and that included systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Most of our recommendations came from 2 publications from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE): the 2011 guidance titled Coexisting Severe Mental Illness (Psychosis) and Substance Misuse: Assessment and Management in Healthcare Settings and the 2014 guidance titled Psychosis and Schizophrenia in Adults: Prevention and Management. We placed these recommendations into the Canadian context to create this guideline. Results: Evidence supports the inclusion of individuals with coexisting substance use disorders in first-episode psychosis programs. The programs should integrate psychosis and substance use treatments, emphasizing ongoing monitoring of both substance use and patterns and symptoms. The best outcomes are achieved with combined use of antipsychotic medications and addiction-based psychosocial interventions. However, limited evidence is available to recommend using one antipsychotic medication over another or one psychosocial intervention over another for persons with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders with coexisting substance use disorders. Conclusions: Treating persons who have schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders with coexisting substance use disorders can present clinical challenges, but modifications in practice can help engage and retain people in treatment, where significant improvements over time can be expected."
Cancer pain management needs and perspectives of patients from Chinese backgrounds: a systematic review of the Chinese and English literature	"OBJECTIVE: More than half of all cancer patients experience unrelieved pain. Culture can significantly affect patients' cancer pain-related beliefs and behaviors. Little is known about cultural impact on Chinese cancer patients' pain management. The objective of this review was to describe pain management experiences of cancer patients from Chinese backgrounds and to identify barriers affecting their pain management. METHOD: A systematic review was conducted adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies were included if they reported pain management experiences of adult cancer patients from Chinese backgrounds. Five databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles published in English or Chinese journals between1990 and 2015. The quality of included studies was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institution's appraisal tools. RESULTS: Of 3,904 identified records, 23 articles met criteria and provided primary data from 6,110 patients. Suboptimal analgesic use, delays in receiving treatment, reluctance to report pain, and/or poor adherence to prescribed analgesics contributed to the patients' inadequate pain control. Patient-related barriers included fatalism, desire to be good, low pain control belief, pain endurance beliefs, and negative effect beliefs. Patients and family shared barriers about fear of addiction and concerns on analgesic side effects and disease progression. Health professional-related barriers were poor communication, ineffective management of pain, and analgesic side effects. Healthcare system-related barriers included limited access to analgesics and/or after hour pain services and lack of health insurance.Significance of resultsChinese cancer patients' misconceptions regarding pain and analgesics may present as the main barriers to optimal pain relief. Findings of this review may inform health interventions to improve cancer pain management outcomes for patients from Chinese backgrounds. Future studies on patients' nonpharmacology intervention-related experiences are required to inform multidisciplinary and biopsychosocial approaches for culturally appropriate pain management."
Cancer patients' experiences of using mistletoe (Viscum album): A qualitative systematic review and synthesis.	"Objective: Systematic reviews of mistletoe therapy (MT) trials in cancer show promising results in improvement of patients' quality of life during chemotherapy and reduction of fatigue. However, patients' experiences of side effects and the acceptability, tolerability, and perceived benefits of MT have not been systematically reviewed. The aim of this study was to systematically review and synthesise the results of qualitative studies of cancer patients' experiences of using MT. Design: A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, PsychLIT, CINAHL, and AMED to identify qualitative studies of MT. Articles were screened independently by two reviewers and critically appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. A thematic synthesis of the findings was carried out. Results: One hundred and seventy-three papers were identified; 156 were excluded at initial screening. Seventeen papers were read in full, 14 of which were excluded. Three articles about patients' experiences of MT alongside conventional treatment were included in the synthesis, either as a monotherapy (two articles) or as part of a package of anthroposophic treatment (one article). Patients reported demonstrable changes to their physical, emotional, and psychosocial well-being following MT, as well as a reduction in chemotherapy side effects. Self-reported side effects from MT were few, and the studies suggest good adherence to the therapy. Self-injection gave patients a sense of empowerment through involvement in their own treatment. Conclusions: A systematic search revealed a small number of qualitative studies of MT in cancer. These were effectively combined to provide a detailed overview of patients' experiences in order to complement the developing evidence base from trials. Given the variation in context of MT delivery across the articles, it is not possible to ascribe changes in patients' quality of life specifically to MT. The results of this review will help in the design of outcome measures that more fully capture patients' experiences. It is essential to embed qualitative research of patients' experiences of MT and other CAM therapies within future trials."
Cancer survivors' experience of exercise-based cancer rehabilitation - a meta-synthesis of qualitative research	"BACKGROUND: Evidence for the safety and benefits of exercise training as a therapeutic and rehabilitative intervention for cancer survivors is accumulating. However, whereas the evidence for the efficacy of exercise training has been established in several meta-analyses, synthesis of qualitative research is lacking. In order to extend healthcare professionals' understanding of the meaningfulness of exercise in cancer survivorship care, this paper aims to identify, appraise and synthesize qualitative studies on cancer survivors' experience of participation in exercise-based rehabilitation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five electronic databases (PubMed, PsychINFO, EMBASE, Cinahl and Scopus) were searched systematically for articles published up to May 2014 using keywords and MeSH terms. To be included, studies had to contain primary data pertaining to patient experiences from participation in supervised, structured moderate to vigorous-intensity exercise. RESULTS: In total 2447 abstracts were screened and 37 papers were read in full. Of these, 19 studies (n = 390) were selected for inclusion and critically appraised. Synthesis of data extracted from eight studies including in total 174 patients (77% women, age 28-76 years) exclusively reporting experiences of participation in structured, supervised exercise training resulted in nine themes condensed into three categories: 1) emergence of continuity; 2) preservation of health; and 3) reclaiming the body reflecting the benefits of exercise-based rehabilitation according to cancer survivors. Accordingly, the potential of rebuilding structure in everyday life, creating a normal context and enabling the individual to re-establish confidentiality and trust in their own body and physical potential constitute substantial qualities fundamental to the understanding of the meaningfulness of exercise-based rehabilitation from the perspective of patients. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the accumulating evidence for the efficacy of exercise training in cancer rehabilitation, it is incumbent upon clinicians and policy-makers to acknowledge and promote the meaningfulness of exercise for the individual, and to use this knowledge to provide new solutions to current problems related to recruitment of underserved populations, long-term adherence and implementation."
"Care planning meetings: Issues for policy, multi-disciplinary practice and patient participation"	"Although Care-Planning Meetings (CPMs) are an increasingly common part of the practice of social work with older people and multi-disciplinary teamwork, it is uncertain how and by whom the voice and wishes of older people, including those with a cognitive impairment, are given due priority. In addition, there is little professional guidance as to how to best plan and facilitate CPMs for older patients with cognitive and communication deficits and other often complex needs. An added challenge is the wide, often diverse and conflicting range of perspectives held by health and social care professionals and other family members who may be involved. This scoping review article on CPMs for older people, considers the facilitators and barriers to effective participation as identified in the literature and proposes suggestions for best practices in CPMs which could help promote an individualised approach to participation that best reflects the older patient""s wishes.

Caregivers' contributions to heart failure self-care: a systematic review	"AIMS: The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review answering the following questions: (a) what specific activities do caregivers (CGs) contribute to patients' self-care in heart failure (HF)?; and (b) how mature (or developed) is the science of the CG contribution to self-care? METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched using the terms heart failure and caregiv* as well as the keywords 'careers', 'family members' and 'lay persons' for studies published between 1948 and September 2012. Inclusion criteria for studies were: informal CGs of adult HF patients-either as dependent/independent variable in quantitative studies or participant in qualitative studies; English language. Exclusion criteria for studies were: formal CGs; pediatric, adult congenital, or devices or transplant CGs; mixed diagnosis; non-empiric reports or reports publishing duplicate results. Each study was abstracted and confirmed by two authors. After CG activities were identified and theoretically categorized, an analysis across studies was conducted. RESULTS: Forty papers were reviewed from a pool of 283 papers. CGs contribute substantively to HF patients' self-care characterized from concrete (weighing the patient) to interpersonal (providing understanding). Only two studies attempted to quantify the impact of CGs' activities on patients' self-care reporting a positive impact. Our analysis provides evidence for a rapidly developing science that is based largely on observational research. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to examine CGs' contributions in depth. Informal caregivers play a major role in HF self-care. Longitudinal research is needed to examine the impact of CGs' contributions on patient self-care outcomes. Copyright ¬© The European Society of Cardiology 2013."
Carer engagement in the hospital care of older people: an integrative literature review	"Aim The aim of this review was to explore the concept of carer engagement in the hospital care of older people and to build theory to inform future research and practice. Background Carer engagement can help to improve the delivery and continuity of care provided to older people in hospital. However, definitions, guidance and structures for carer engagement in hospitals are lacking and there can be tensions and conflicts about the role of carers in hospitals. Method Integrative literature review. Literature searches identified 2745 peer-reviewed articles and studies published between January 1990 and November 2015 in the following databases: PubMed, Cochrane, Medline, EMBASE and CINHAL. After applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, the sample (103 articles) was subject to thematic analysis. Results Current evidence on carer engagement is dispersed across different research literatures on clinical conditions and contexts. Six distinct components of carer engagement were identified: patient caregiving, information sharing, shared decision-making, carer support and education, carer feedback and patient care transitions. Conclusion Hospitals can adopt a more consistent and comprehensive approach to carer engagement for older people by developing and supporting the different components of carer engagement identified. Implications for practice The integrated model of carer engagement developed here could help staff and hospitals to develop strategies, staff training and resources that work with rather than against carers. The findings can inform future research on carer engagement interventions and associated outcomes for patients, carers and staff."
Carers' experiences when the person for whom they have been caring enters a residential aged care facility permanently: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Primary research, including qualitative research, as well as experts working in social services and aged care have identified the mixed feelings carers experience when the person they have been caring for is admitted into a residential aged care facility permanently. They have raised the importance of understanding these experiences as a means to implementing policies and programs that enhance carers' well-being. This systematic review was motivated by the need to use evidence to inform effective and feasible interventions to support carers, and the absence of a systematic review synthesizing the qualitative evidence on how carers experience this transition. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this qualitative systematic review was to identify and synthesize the evidence on the experiences of carers of older people when the person they had been providing care for is admitted permanently into a residential aged care facility, and to draw recommendations from the synthesis of the evidence on these experiences to enhance policy and programming aimed at supporting affected caregivers. INCLUSION CRITERIA: TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: All carers of people who had experienced the person they had been caring for at home being moved into a residential aged care facility permanently. PHENOMENA OF INTEREST: Experiences of the caregiver of the older person when the person they have been caring for at home is admitted into a residential aged care facility permanently. TYPES OF STUDIES: The review considered qualitative studies, including but not limited to designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography and action research. TYPES OF OUTCOMES: The outcomes are in the form of synthesized findings pertaining to carers' experiences when the person they have been caring for is admitted into a residential aged care facility permanently. SEARCH STRATEGY: A comprehensive search of leading databases which are sources of qualitative published and unpublished studies was conducted between 18 September 2013 and 10 November 2013. The search considered studies reported in English and published from the database inception to 10 November 2013. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Papers selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted from identified papers using the standardized data extraction tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. The data extracted included descriptive details about the phenomena of interest, populations and study methods. DATA SYNTHESIS: The Joanna Briggs Institute meta-aggregative approach for synthesizing qualitative evidence was used. Research findings were pooled using the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. Study findings that were supported by the data in primary studies were organized into categories on the basis of similarity of meaning. These categories were then subjected to a meta-synthesis to produce a set of synthesized findings. RESULTS: Fourteen studies matched the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. From these 14 studies a total of 71 study findings about how carers experience the transition when the person they have been caring for is TRUNCATED AT 500 WORDS.

"Carers' Experiences, Needs, and Preferences During Inpatient Stroke Rehabilitation: A Systematic Review of Qualitative Studies"	"Objective To report and synthesize the experiences, needs, and preferences of carers of stroke survivors undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. Data Sources MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were searched to March 2016. Reference lists of relevant publications were searched. No language restrictions were applied. Study Selection Eligible qualitative studies reported the experiences of carers of stroke survivors who underwent inpatient rehabilitation. The search yielded 3532 records; 93 full-text publications were assessed for eligibility, and 34 documents (33 studies) were included. Comprehensiveness of reporting was assessed using the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Health Research framework. Data Extraction Data on the characteristics of included studies were independently extracted by 2 authors. Differences in data extraction between authors were resolved through discussion or by a third author. All text in studies' results and discussion sections were extracted for analysis. Data Synthesis Extracted texts were analyzed inductively using thematic synthesis. Seven analytical themes were developed that related to the carers' experiences, needs, and preferences: (1) overwhelmed with emotions; (2) recognition as a stakeholder in recovery; (3) desire to be heard and informed; (4) persisting for action and outcomes; (5) being legitimate clients; (6) navigating an alien culture and environment; and (7) managing the transition home. Conclusions This systematic review provides new insights into the experiences, needs, and preferences of carers of stroke survivors undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. Carers experienced distress as they navigated a foreign culture and environment without adequate communication and processes in place for their inclusion. We recommend deliberate efforts to provide a more inclusive environment that better supports and prepares carers for their new role."
Caring for older people with an intellectual disability: a systematic review	"This review critically evaluates the available research literature on aging among people with an intellectual disability. 42 papers meeting the review inclusion criteria are presented under three themes: studies with a service user perspective (13), studies of carers of older people with ID (14) and studies of service provision for older people with ID (15). User view specific findings relate to concerns about accommodation; experiences of services; and perceptions of aging; with a common underlying finding from all user focused themes that of unmet need. Carer specific findings relate to fear of the future; experiences of older carers; and planning for the future. Services themes reflect the debate over specialist or generalist services as people age; accommodation; retirement from day services; and staff training. Overall this review reveals a lack of robust research evidence concerning the lives of older people with ID and a need for more research that directly engages with older people with ID and their carers.

Challenges in the Evaluation of Interventions to Improve Engagement Along the HIV Care Continuum in the United States: A Systematic Review	"In the United States (US), there are high levels of disengagement along the HIV care continuum. We sought to characterize the heterogeneity in research studies and interventions to improve care engagement among people living with diagnosed HIV infection. We performed a systematic literature search for interventions to improve HIV linkage to care, retention in care, reengagement in care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the US published from 2007-mid 2015. Study designs and outcomes were allowed to vary in included studies. We grouped interventions into categories, target populations, and whether results were significantly improved. We identified 152 studies, 7 (5%) linkage studies, 33 (22%) retention studies, 4 (3%) reengagement studies, and 117 (77%) adherence studies. 'Linkage' studies utilized 11 different outcome definitions, while 'retention' studies utilized 39, with very little consistency in effect measurements. The majority (59%) of studies reported significantly improved outcomes, but this proportion and corresponding effect sizes varied substantially across study categories. This review highlights a paucity of assessments of linkage and reengagement interventions; limited generalizability of results; and substantial heterogeneity in intervention types, outcome definitions, and effect measures. In order to make strides against the HIV epidemic in the US, care continuum research must be improved and benchmarked against an integrated, comprehensive framework."

Challenges with access to healthcare from the perspective of patients living with HIV: a scoping review & framework synthesis	"Accessing healthcare can be difficult but the barriers multiply for people living with HIV (PLHIV). To improve access and the health of PLHIV, we must consider their perspectives and use them to inform standard practice. A better understanding of the current literature related to healthcare access from the perspective of PLHIV, can help to identify evidence gaps and highlight research priorities and opportunities. To identify relevant peer-reviewed publications, search strategies were employed. Electronic and grey literature databases were explored. Articles were screened based on their title and abstract and those that met the screening criteria, were reviewed in full. Data analysis was conducted using a collaborative approach that included knowledge user consultation. Initial concepts were extracted, summarized and through framework synthesis, developed into emerging and final themes. From 20,678 articles, 326 articles met the initial screening criteria and 64 were reviewed in full. The final themes identified, in order of most to least frequent were: Acceptability, Availability, Accessibility, Affordability, Other Barriers, Communication, Satisfaction, Accommodation, Preferences and Equity in Access. The most frequently discussed concepts related to negative interactions with staff, followed by long wait times, limited household resources or inability to pay fees, and fear of one's serostatus being disclosed. Knowledge users were in agreement with the categorization of initial concepts and final themes; however, some gaps in the literature were identified. Specific changes are critical to improving access to healthcare for PLHIV. These include improving availability by ensuring staff and healthcare professionals have proper training, cultivating acceptability and reducing stigma through improving HIV awareness, increasing accessibility through increased HIV information for PLHIV and improved dissemination of this information to increase patient knowledge and health awareness. Finally, ensuring proper protocols are implemented and followed to guarantee patient confidentiality and overall satisfaction with healthcare services are recommended."
Characteristics and quality of clinical practice guidelines for depression in adults: a scoping review.	"BACKGROUND: Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) should follow an adequate methodology using an evidence-based approach in order to provide reliable recommendations. However, little is known regarding the quality of CPGs for Depression, which precludes its adequate use by stakeholders and mental health professionals. Thus, the aim of this study was to conduct a scoping review to describe the characteristics and quality of CPGs for Depression in adults. METHODS: We searched CPGs for Depression in adults in eighteen databases. We included those that were published in English or Spanish between January 2014 and May 2018 and were based on systematic reviews of the evidence. Two independent authors extracted the characteristics, type and number of recommendations, and quality (using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II AGREE-II]) of each included CPG. RESULTS: We included eleven CPGs, of which 9/11 did not include the participation of patients in the development of the CPG, 4/11 CPGs had a score >= 70% in the overall evaluation of AGREE-II, and 3/11 CPGs had a score >= 70% in its third domain (rigor of development). In addition, only 5/11 CPGs shared their search strategy, while only 4/11 listed the selected studies they used to reach recommendations, and 7/11 CPGs did not clearly state which methodology they used to translate evidence into a recommendation. CONCLUSIONS: Most of evaluated CPGs did not take into account the patient's viewpoints, achieved a low score in the rigor of development domain, and did not clearly state the process used to reach the recommendations. Stakeholders, CPCGs developers, and CPGs users should take this into account when choosing CPGs, and interpreting and putting into practice their issued recommendations."
Characteristics of Indigenous primary health care service delivery models: a systematic scoping review.	"BACKGROUND: Indigenous populations have poorer health outcomes compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts. The evolution of Indigenous primary health care services arose from mainstream health services being unable to adequately meet the needs of Indigenous communities and Indigenous peoples often being excluded and marginalised from mainstream health services. Part of the solution has been to establish Indigenous specific primary health care services, for and managed by Indigenous peoples. There are a number of reasons why Indigenous primary health care services are more likely than mainstream services to improve the health of Indigenous communities. Their success is partly due to the fact that they often provide comprehensive programs that incorporate treatment and management, prevention and health promotion, as well as addressing the social determinants of health. However, there are gaps in the evidence base including the characteristics that contribute to the success of Indigenous primary health care services in providing comprehensive primary health care. This systematic scoping review aims to identify the characteristics of Indigenous primary health care service delivery models. METHOD: This systematic scoping review was led by an Aboriginal researcher, using the Joanna Briggs Institute Scoping Review Methodology. All published peer-reviewed and grey literature indexed in PubMed, EBSCO CINAHL, Embase, Informit, Mednar, and Trove databases from September 1978 to May 2015 were reviewed for inclusion. Studies were included if they describe the characteristics of service delivery models implemented within an Indigenous primary health care service. Sixty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted and then thematically analysed to identify the characteristics of Indigenous PHC service delivery models. RESULTS: Culture was the most prominent characteristic underpinning all of the other seven characteristics which were identified - accessible health services, community participation, continuous quality improvement, culturally appropriate and skilled workforce, flexible approach to care, holistic health care, and self-determination and empowerment. CONCLUSION: While the eight characteristics were clearly distinguishable within the review, the interdependence between each characteristic was also evident. These findings were used to develop a new Indigenous PHC Service Delivery Model, which clearly demonstrates some of the unique characteristics of Indigenous specific models."

Characterizing patient-oriented tools that could be packaged with guidelines to promote self-management and guideline adoption: a meta-review	"BACKGROUND: Self-management is an important component of care for patients or consumers (henceforth termed patients) with chronic conditions. Research shows that patients view guidelines as potential sources of self-management support. However, few guidelines provide such support. The primary purpose of this study was to characterize effective types of self-management interventions that could be packaged as resources in (i.e., appendices) or with guidelines (i.e., accompanying products). METHODS: We conducted a meta-review of systematic reviews that evaluated self-management interventions. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from 2005 to 2014 for English language systematic reviews. Data were extracted on study characteristics, intervention (content, delivery, duration, personnel, single or multifaceted), and outcomes. Interventions were characterized by the type of component for different domains (inform, activate, collaborate). Summary statistics were used to report the characteristics, frequency, and impact of the types of self-management components. A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) was used to assess the methodological quality of included reviews. RESULTS: Seventy-seven studies were included (14 low, 44 moderate, 18 high risk of bias). Reviews addressed numerous clinical topics, most frequently diabetes (23, 30 %). Fifty-four focused on single (38 educational, 16 self-directed) and 21 on multifaceted interventions. Support for collaboration with providers was the least frequently used form of self-management. Most conditions featured multiple types of self-management components. The most frequently occurring type of self-management component across all studies was lifestyle advice (72 %), followed by psychological strategies (69 %), and information about the condition (49 %). In most reviews, the intervention both informed and activated patients (57, 76 %). Among the reviews that achieved positive results, 83 % of interventions involved activation alone, 94 % in combination with information, and 95 % in combination with information and collaboration. No trends in the characteristics and impact of self-management by condition were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed numerous opportunities for enhancing guidelines with resources for both patients and providers to support self-management. This includes single resources that provide information and/or prompt activation. Further research is needed to more firmly establish the statistical association between the characteristics of self-management support and outcomes; and to and optimize the design of self-management resources that are included in or with guidelines, in particular, resources that prompt collaboration with providers."
Child and youth participatory interventions for addressing lifestyle-related childhood obesity: a systematic review	"A growing number of childhood obesity interventions involve children and youth in participatory roles, but these types of interventions have not been systematically reviewed. We aimed to identify child and youth participatory interventions in the peer-reviewed literature in order to characterize the approaches and examine their impact on obesity and obesity-related lifestyle behaviours. We searched PubMed/Medline, psychINFO and ERIC for quasi-experimental and randomized trials conducted from date of database initiation through May 2015 that engaged children or youth in implementing healthy eating, physical activity or weight management strategies. Eighteen studies met our eligibility criteria. Most (n = 14) trained youth to implement pre-defined strategies targeting their peers. A few (n = 4) assisted youth to plan and implement interventions that addressed environmental changes. Thirteen studies reported at least one statistically significant weight, physical activity or dietary change outcome. Participatory approaches have potential, but variation in strategies and outcomes leave questions unanswered about the mechanisms through which child and youth engagement impact childhood obesity. Future research should compare child-delivered or youth-delivered to adult-delivered health promotion interventions and more rigorously evaluate natural experiments that engage youth to implement environmental changes. With careful attention to theoretical frameworks, process and outcome measures, these studies could strengthen the effectiveness of child and youth participatory approaches.

Children and Adolescents Mental Health: A Systematic Review of Interaction-Based Interventions in Schools and Communities.	"Background: There is growing evidence and awareness regarding the magnitude of mental health issues across the globe, starting half of those before the age of 14 and have lifelong effects on individuals and society. Despite the multidimensional nature of this global challenge, which necessarily require comprehensive approaches, many interventions persist in seeking solutions that only tackle the individual level. The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic review of evidence for positive effects in children and adolescents' mental health resulting from interventions conducted in schools and communities in which interaction among different agents is an integral component. Methods: An extensive search in electronic databases (Web of Knowledge, SCOPUS, ERIC, and PsycINFO) was conducted to identify interventions in which interactions between peers, teachers, families or other community members or professionals played a role. Their effects on children and adolescents' mental health were also reviewed. We carried out a systematic review of papers published from 2007 to 2017. Eleven studies out of 384 met the inclusion criteria. Seven of the articles reviewed focus on interventions conducted in schools and promote supportive interactions involving students, teachers, families and mental health professionals. Four of the articles develop interventions that engage community members in dialogic interactions with children and adolescents. Results: Interventions in schools and communities implement strategies that foster supportive interactions among diverse actors including teachers, parents, community members, and other professionals. The effects of the mental health interventions reported on children and adolescents' problems include a decrease in disruptive behaviors and affective symptoms such as depression and anxiety, together with an increase in social skills, as well as an improvement in personal well-being. Conclusions: There is evidence of a positive effect on the mental health of children and adolescents, both in decreasing symptoms of mental disorder and in promoting emotional well-being. Whereas, interactions among different actors seem to be a relevant aspect across the interventions, more research is needed to conclude its effect on the outcomes of the studies reviewed."
Children and young people's participation in developing interventions in health and well-being: a scoping review	"BACKGROUND: Greater interest is being shown in participatory approaches, especially in research on interventions that concern children and young people's health and well-being. Although participatory approaches have user involvement in common, they differ in terms of the explicit guidance on how to actually involve and engage children and young people in health research. The aim of this scoping review was to systematically map recent research involving children and young people in the development of interventions targeting issues of health and well-being. METHODS: An interpretative scoping literature review based on: a scientific literature search in (health and social science) databases, reference lists, a manual search in key journals and contact with existing networks was conducted. A total of 4458 references were identified through the literature search, of which 41 studies published between 2000 and 2017 were included in the review. The target population was children and young people under 25 years old. Level of participation was categorized according to Shier's Pathways to Participation Model. RESULTS: The review showed that participatory approaches were most often used in the development of interventions in school settings and in community and healthcare settings and on issues concerning support in lifestyle or in managing illness or disease. The level of participation varied from children and young people taking part just as active informants, through stages of greater participation both in quantitative and qualitative terms, to children and young people becoming an active agent involved as a co-researcher where the research process was shaped by views of a higher level of mutuality. Most of the studies were categorised at a medium level and only three studies were judged to involve the children and young people at the highest level. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review showed that work remains in enabling children and young people to influence the development of interventions targeting health and well-being. In relation to level of sustainability in the interventions, it is relevant that goals, strategies and processes are formulated by those who can gain from the interventions. Participatory approaches aiming for a higher level of participation where children and young people work together with the researchers in partnerships are thus warranted."
Choosing important health outcomes for comparative effectiveness research: 4th annual update to a systematic review of core outcome sets for research.	"BACKGROUND: The Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) database is a publically available, searchable repository of published and ongoing core outcome set (COS) studies. An annual systematic review update is carried out to maintain the currency of database content. METHODS: The methods used in the fourth update of the systematic review followed the same approach used in the original review and previous updates. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported the development of a COS, regardless of any restrictions by age, health condition or setting. Searches were carried out in March 2018 to identify studies that had been published or indexed between January 2017 and the end of December 2017. RESULTS: Forty-eight new studies, describing the development of 56 COS, were included. There has been an increase in the number of studies clearly specifying the scope of the COS in terms of the population (n = 43, 90%) and intervention (n = 48, 100%) characteristics. Public participation has continued to rise with over half (n = 27, 56%) of studies in the current review including input from members of the public. The rate of inclusion of all stakeholder groups has increased, in particular participation from non-clinical research experts has risen from 32% (mean average in previous reviews) to 62% (n = 29). Input from participants located in Australasia (n = 17; 41%), Asia (n = 18; 44%), South America (n = 13; 32%) and Africa (n = 7; 17%) have all increased since the previous reviews. CONCLUSION: This update included a pronounced increase in the number of new COS identified compared to the previous three updates. There was an improvement in the reporting of the scope, stakeholder participants and methods used. Furthermore, there has been an increase in participation from Australasia, Asia, South America and Africa. These advancements are reflective of the efforts made in recent years to raise awareness about the need for COS development and uptake, as well as developments in COS methodology."
Choosing important health outcomes for comparative effectiveness research: An updated systematic review and involvement of low and middle income countries	"BACKGROUND: Core outcome sets (COS) comprise a minimum set of outcomes that should be measured and reported in all trials for a specific health condition. The COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials) Initiative maintains an up to date, publicly accessible online database of published and ongoing COS. An annual systematic review update is an important part of this process. METHODS: This review employed the same, multifaceted approach that was used in the original review and the previous two updates. This approach has identified studies that sought to determine which outcomes/domains to measure in clinical trials of a specific condition. This update includes an analysis of the inclusion of participants from low and middle income countries (LMICs) as identified by the OECD, in these COS. RESULTS: Eighteen publications, relating to 15 new studies describing the development of 15 COS, were eligible for inclusion in the review. Results show an increase in the use of mixed methods, including Delphi surveys. Clinical experts remain the most common stakeholder group involved. Overall, only 16% of the 259 COS studies published up to the end of 2016 have included participants from LMICs. CONCLUSION: This review highlights opportunities for greater public participation in COS development and the involvement of stakeholders from a wider range of geographical settings, in particular LMICs."
Choosing to have an illegal abortion in Southern Africa: A comprehensive systematic review of the qualitative text and opinion-based evidence.	"Background In South Africa the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act (Act 92 of 1996) replaced the Abortion and Sterilization Act (Act No 2 of 1975). The Abortion and Sterilization Act allowed for termination of pregnancy for specific reasons and conditions. The current Act of 1996 allows for termination of pregnancy at the mother's request up until the 12th week of pregnancy and under specific conditions up to and including the 20th week of pregnancy. The existence of legal abortion does not mean that the abortion is safe. An unsafe abortion, also referred to as an illegal abortion, is a procedure to terminate an unwanted pregnancy performed either by individuals lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not have basic medical standards, or both. Objectives The objective of this systematic review was to critically appraise, synthesize and present the best available evidence in relation to why women choose to undergo an ""illegal"" or ""unsafe"" abortion when abortion is legal and readily available in South Africa. Inclusion criteria Types of participants This systematic review considered any qualitative study where the focus was on pregnant women of childbearing age who have had an illegal abortion and who lived in Southern Africa. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest The phenomena of interest of this review were the reasons why women choose illegal abortions in situations where abortion is freely available. Social and demographic data of participants were extracted from studies where possible. For the purpose of this systematic review, studies that use terms such as ""unsafe"" abortion, or abortions conducted in ""non-medical settings"" were considered to be illegal abortions and were considered for inclusion in the review. Types of studies This review considered studies that focused on qualitative data including, but not limited to, designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research and feminist research. This review also considered non-research papers such as text and opinion-based papers and reports. Types of outcomes Studies that were conducted in public or private health care settings were considered for inclusion in the review. Health care settings may include hospitals, clinics and non-governmental organizations that offer supportive services to women who have had an abortion. Search strategy The following initial key words were used: Childbearing women, illegal abortions, unsafe abortions, backstreet abortions, qualitative research, Southern Africa The following search strategy was undertaken: 1. A limited search of PubMed and CINAHL to identify relevant keywords contained in the title, abstract and subject descriptors 2. Terms identified in this way and the synonyms used by respective databases were used in an extensive search of the literature. Databases searched in this stage included PubMed, CINAHL, SABINET, Scopus, Africa Journal Online, PsychINFO, SocINDEX, SAePublications and Global Health. 3. Reference lists and bibliographies of the articles chosen from those identified in stage 2 were searched. 4. Gray literature identified through reference lists were searched and where African journals of health care were not identified in databases, appropriate hand searching was done. Methodological quality Assessment of methodological data Qualitative papers selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI)). Any disagreements that arose between the reviewers were resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. Data collection Qualitative data were extracted from papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI-QARI. The data extracted included specific details about the phenomena of interest, populations, study methods and outcomes of significance to the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Qualitative research findings, where possible, were pooled using JBI-QARI. This involved the aggregation or synthesis of findings to generate a set of statements that represented that aggregation, through assembling the findings (Level 1 findings) rated according to their quality, and categorizing these findings on the basis of similarity in meaning (Level 2 findings). These categories were then subjected to a meta-synthesis in order to produce a single comprehensive set of synthesized findings (Level 3 findings) that can be used as a basis for evidence-based practice. Results JBI-QARI was used to extract findings relevant to the review question from the two included studies. No text and opinion papers were found. Based on similarity of findings, categories were identified and then used to construct a synthesis. Each finding was graded based on its credibility. Only those findings that provided a direct quote from the participant were classed as unequivocal and were given more weight in the synthesis. There were no findings that were classed as credible or unsupported. The nine findings were grouped into three categories and the latter into one synthesized statement. Conclusions The evidence as to why women choose unsafe or illegal abortions when legal abortions are available is scarce. Current evidence suggests that reasons are multifactorial and complex. Women seek abortions for personal reasons such as wishing to pursue an education, not being financially secure, being afraid of parental and partner response to the news of a pregnancy, and denial of the pregnancy either by the partner or the woman herself. ¬© the authors 2013."
Choosing treatment and screening options congruent with values: Do decision aids help? Sub-analysis of a systematic review	"OBJECTIVE: To understand how well patients make value congruent decisions with and without patient decision aids (PtDAs) for screening and treatment options, and identify issues with its measurement and evaluation. METHODS: A sub-analysis of trials included in the 2014 Cochrane Review of Decision Aids. Eligible trials measured value congruence with chosen option. Two reviewers independently screened 115 trials. RESULTS: Among 18 included trials, 8 (44%) measured value congruence using the Multidimensional Measure of Informed Choice (MMIC), 7 (39%) used heterogeneous methods, and 3 (17%) used unclear methods. Pooled results of trials that used heterogeneous measures were statistically non-significant (n=3). Results from trials that used the MMIC suggest patients are 48% more likely to make value congruent decisions when exposed to a PtDA for a screening decision (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.16, n=8). CONCLUSION: Patients struggle to make value congruent decisions, but PtDAs may help. While the absolute improvement is relatively small it may be underestimated due to sample size issues, definitions, and heterogeneity of measures. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Current approaches are inadequate to support patients making decisions that are consistent with their values. There is some evidence that PtDAs support patients with achieving values congruent decisions for screening choices. Copyright ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
Chronic disease management programmes for adults with asthma.	"Background The burden of asthma on patients and healthcare systems is substantial. Interventions have been developed to overcome difficulties in asthma management. These include chronic disease management programmes, which are more than simple patient education, encompassing a set of coherent interventions that centre on the patients' needs, encouraging the co-ordination and integration of health services provided by a variety of healthcare professionals, and emphasising patient self-management as well as patient education. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of chronic disease management programmes for adults with asthma. Search methods Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE (MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations), EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched up to June 2014. We also handsearched selected journals from 2000 to 2012 and scanned reference lists of relevant reviews. Selection criteria We included individual or cluster-randomised controlled trials, non-randomised controlled trials, and controlled before-after studies comparing chronic disease management programmes with usual care in adults over 16 years of age with a diagnosis of asthma. The chronic disease management programmes had to satisfy at least the following five criteria: an organisational component targeting patients; an organisational component targeting healthcare professionals or the healthcare system, or both; patient education or self-management support, or both; active involvement of two or more healthcare professionals in patient care; a minimum duration of three months. Data collection and analysis After an initial screen of the titles, two review authors working independently assessed the studies for eligibility and study quality; they also extracted the data. We contacted authors to obtain missing information and additional data, where necessary. We pooled results using the random-effects model and reported the pooled mean or standardised mean differences (SMDs). Main results A total of 20 studies including 81,746 patients (median 129.5) were included in this review, with a follow-up ranging from 3 to more than 12 months. Patients' mean age was 42.5 years, 60% were female, and their asthma was mostly rated as moderate to severe. Overall the studies were of moderate to low methodological quality, because of limitations in their design and the wide confidence intervals for certain results. Authors' conclusions There is moderate to low quality evidence that chronic disease management programmes for adults with asthma can improve asthma-specific quality of life, asthma severity, and lung function tests. Overall, these results provide encouraging evidence of the potential effectiveness of these programmes in adults with asthma when compared with usual care. However, the optimal composition of asthma chronic disease management programmes and their added value, compared with education or self-management alone that is usually offered to patients with asthma, need further investigation."
Clarifying the mechanisms and resources that enable the reciprocal involvement of seldom heard groups in health and social care research: A collaborative rapid realist review process	"OBJECTIVE: Public and patient involvement is increasingly embedded as a core activity in research funding calls and best practice guidelines. However, there is recognition of the challenges that prevail to achieve genuine and equitable forms of engagement. Our objective was to identify the mechanisms and resources that enable the reciprocal involvement of seldom heard groups in health and social care research. METHODS: A rapid realist review of the literature that included: (a) a systematic search of CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed and Open Grey (2007-2017); (b) documents provided by expert panel members of relevant journals and grey literature. Six reference panels were undertaken with homeless, women's, transgender, disability and Traveller and Roma organizations to capture local insights. Data were extracted into a theory-based grid linking context to behaviour change policy categories. MAIN RESULTS: From the review, 20 documents were identified and combined with the reference panel summaries. The expert panel reached consensus about 33 programme theories. These relate to environmental and social planning (7); service provision (6); guidelines (4); fiscal measures (6); communication and marketing (4); and regulation and legislation (6). CONCLUSIONS: While there is growing evidence of the merits of undertaking PPI, this rarely extends to the meaningful involvement of seldom heard groups. The 33 programme theories agreed by the expert panel point to a variety of mechanisms and resources that need to be considered. Many of the programme theories identified point to the need for a radical shift in current practice to enable the reciprocal involvement of seldom heard groups.

"Client preferences affect treatment satisfaction, completion, and clinical outcome: a meta-analysis."	"We conducted a meta-analysis on the effects of client preferences on treatment satisfaction, completion, and clinical outcome. Our search of the literature resulted in 34 empirical articles describing 32 unique clinical trials that either randomized some clients to an active choice condition (shared decision making condition or choice of treatment) or assessed client preferences. Clients who were involved in shared decision making, chose a treatment condition, or otherwise received their preferred treatment evidenced higher treatment satisfaction (ESd=.34; p<.001), increased completion rates (ESOR=1.37; ESd=.17; p<.001), and superior clinical outcome (ESd=.15; p<.0001), compared to clients who were not involved in shared decision making, did not choose a treatment condition, or otherwise did not receive their preferred treatment. Although the effect sizes are modest in magnitude, they were generally consistent across several potential moderating variables including study design (preference versus active choice), psychoeducation (informed versus uninformed), setting (inpatient versus outpatient), client diagnosis (mental health versus other), and unit of randomization (client versus provider). Our findings highlight the clinical benefit of assessing client preferences, providing treatment choices when two or more efficacious options are available, and involving clients in treatment-related decisions when treatment options are not available.

"Clinical uncertainties, health service challenges, and ethical complexities of HIV ""test-and-treat"": a systematic review"	"Despite the HIV ""test-and-treat"" strategy's promise, questions about its clinical rationale, operational feasibility, and ethical appropriateness have led to vigorous debate in the global HIV community. We performed a systematic review of the literature published between January 2009 and May 2012 using PubMed, SCOPUS, Global Health, Web of Science, BIOSIS, Cochrane CENTRAL, EBSCO Africa-Wide Information, and EBSCO CINAHL Plus databases to summarize clinical uncertainties, health service challenges, and ethical complexities that may affect the test-and-treat strategy's success. A thoughtful approach to research and implementation to address clinical and health service questions and meaningful community engagement regarding ethical complexities may bring us closer to safe, feasible, and effective test-and-treat implementation."
Clinician descriptions of communication strategies to improve treatment engagement by racial/ethnic minorities in mental health services: A systematic review.	"Objective: To describe studies on clinician communication and the engagement of racial/ethnic minority patients in mental health treatment. Methods: Authors conducted electronic searches of published and grey literature databases from inception to November 2014, forward citation analyses, and backward bibliographic sampling of included articles. Included studies reported original data on clinician communication strategies to improve minority treatment engagement, defined as initiating, participating, and continuing services. Results: Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria. Low treatment initiation and high treatment discontinuation were related to patient views that the mental health system did not address their understandings of illness, care or stigma. Treatment participation was based more on clinician language use, communication style, and discussions of patient-clinician differences. Conclusion: Clinicians may improve treatment initiation and continuation by incorporating patient views of illness into treatment and targeting stigma. Clinicians may improve treatment participation by using simple language, tailoring communication to patient preferences, discussing differences, and demonstrating positive affect. Practice implications: Lack of knowledge about the mental health system and somatic symptoms may delay treatment initiation. Discussions of clinician backgrounds, power, and communication style may improve treatment participation. Treatment continuation may improve if clinicians tailor communication and treatment plans congruent with patient expectations."
Co-design of mHealth Delivered Interventions: A Systematic Review to Assess Key Methods and Processes.	"Most mobile health (mHealth) programmes are designed with minimal input from target end users and are not truly personalised or adaptive to their specific and evolving needs. This review describes the methods and processes used in the co-design of mHealth interventions. Nine relevant studies of varying design were identified following searches of six academic databases. All employed co-design or participatory methods for the development of a health intervention delivered via a mobile device, with three focusing on health behaviour change (one on nutrition) and six on management of a health condition. Overall, six key phases of design and 17 different methods were used. Sufficiency of reporting was poor, and no study undertook a robust assessment of efficacy; these factors should be a focus for future studies. An opportunity exists to use co-design methods to develop acceptable and feasible mHealth interventions, especially to support improved nutrition and for minority and indigenous groups."
Co-research with adults with intellectual disability: A systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Co-research with people with intellectual disability is a distinct form of patient and public involvement (PPI). This systematic review summarize published studies and protocols to report on the process of co-research in social and healthcare research. METHOD: Relevant studies were identified using electronic searches on ASSIA, PsycInfo and MedLine. Study quality was assessed, and information relevant to the process of working with co-researchers was extracted and thematically analysed. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were retrieved. Data are reported under three themes: (i) challenges of co-research; (ii) facilitators of co-research; (iii) benefits of co-research. Best practice is presented as a model of co-research. Content analysis on 12 research protocols identified four themes related to PPI. CONCLUSIONS: All stakeholders involved in co-research with people with intellectual disability can benefit, providing there is adequate infrastructure to accommodate and empower the co-researchers. Many current intellectual disability research projects still lack systematic involvement of PPI members. Copyright ¬© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Collaboration between local health and local government agencies for health improvement	"BACKGROUND: In many countries, national, regional and local inter- and intra-agency collaborations have been introduced to improve health outcomes. Evidence is needed on the effectiveness of locally developed partnerships which target changes in health outcomes and behaviours. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of interagency collaboration between local health and local government agencies on health outcomes in any population or age group. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Public Health Group Specialised Register, AMED, ASSIA, CENTRAL, CINAHL, DoPHER, EMBASE, ERIC, HMIC, IBSS, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, OpenGrey, PsycINFO, Rehabdata, Social Care Online, Social Services Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, TRoPHI and Web of Science from 1966 through to January 2012. 'Snowballing' methods were used, including expert contact, citation tracking, website searching and reference list follow-up. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series (ITS) where the study reported individual health outcomes arising from interagency collaboration between health and local government agencies compared to standard care. Studies were selected independently in duplicate, with no restriction on population subgroup or disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently conducted data extraction and assessed risk of bias for each study. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen studies were identified (28,212 participants). Only two were considered to be at low risk of bias. Eleven studies contributed data to the meta-analyses but a narrative synthesis was undertaken for all 16 studies. Six studies examined mental health initiatives, of which one showed health benefit, four showed modest improvement in one or more of the outcomes measured but no clear overall health gain, and one showed no evidence of health gain. Four studies considered lifestyle improvements, of which one showed some limited short-term improvements, two failed to show health gains for the intervention population, and one showed more unhealthy lifestyle behaviours persisting in the intervention population. Three studies considered chronic disease management and all failed to demonstrate health gains. Three studies considered environmental improvements and adjustments, of which two showed some health improvements and one did not.Meta-analysis of three studies exploring the effect of collaboration on mortality showed no effect (pooled relative risk of 1.04 in favour of control, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.17). Analysis of five studies (with high heterogeneity) looking at the effect of collaboration on mental health resulted in a standardised mean difference of -0.28, a small effect favouring the intervention (95% CI -0.51 to -0.06). From two studies, there was a statistically significant but clinically modest improvement in the global assessment of function symptoms score scale, with a pooled mean difference (on a scale of 1 to 100) of -2.63 favouring the intervention (95% CI -5.16 to -0.10).For physical health (6 studies) and quality of life (4 studies) the results were not statistically significant, the standardised mean differences were -0.01 (95% CI -0.10 to 0.07) and -0.08 (95% CI -0.44 to 0.27), respectively. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Collaboration between local health and local government is commonly considered best practice. However, the review did not identify any reliable evidence that interagency collaboration, compared to standard services, necessarily leads to health improvement. A few studies identified component benefits but these were not reflected in overall outcome scores and could have resulted from the use of significant additional resources. Although agencies appear enthusiastic about collaboration, difficulties in the primary studies and incomplete implementation of initiatives have prevented the development of a strong evidence base. If these weaknesses are addressed in future studies (for example by providing greater detail on the implementation of programmes; using more robust designs, integrated process evaluations to show how well the partners of the collaboration worked together, and measurement of health outcomes) it could provide a better understanding of what might work and why. It is possible that local collaborative partnerships delivering environmental Interventions may result in health gain but the evidence base for this is very limited.Evaluations of interagency collaborative arrangements face many challenges. The results demonstrate that collaborative community partnerships can be established to deliver interventions but it is important to agree goals, methods of working, monitoring and evaluation before implementation to protect programme fidelity and increase the potential for effectiveness."
Collective empowerment strategies for patients with Diabetes Mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis	"AIMS: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify and analyze collective empowerment strategies for patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM). METHODS: The systematic review was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE, Science Direct and BVS. The term ""Diabetes Mellitus"" was used with each of the following describers, along with the connector ""AND"": ""self-care"", ""health education"", ""motivation"" and ""empowerment"". Inclusion criteria were: intervention study with control group published between 2004 and 2014. For meta-analysis, RevMan V 5.3 software was used. RESULTS: Among the nine analyzed articles, 66.7% (n=6) were developed in patients diagnosed with DM2. Concerning the indicators for intervention effectiveness evaluation, all articles (n=9) used glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and the most used instrument was Summary of Diabetes Self Care Activities Measure, representing 44.4% (n=4) of the studies. The types of strategies used were similar in the articles. There was evidence of a decrease in HbA1c levels in 66.7% (n=6). The meta-analysis found significant evidence indicating beneficial effects of empowerment. CONCLUSIONS: Programs based on collective empowerment in DM have shown the interventions lead to improvement in clinical parameters, behavior, increased knowledge about DM, and self-care.

Combating Opioid Overdose With Public Access to Naloxone	"Purpose: Opioid overdose deaths have become an escalating epidemic in the United States. To combat this complex issue, naloxone distribution to the public has been initiated in many states as a harm reduction strategy. While supportive legislation develops and community programs expand, research- and policy-focused literature surrounding this timely topic require exploration, compilation, and analysis. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify trends in the current literature, gaps in the findings, nursing implications, and opportunities for further exploration. Methods: Following a systematic approach, the keywords ""naloxone"" and ""opioid overdose"" were used to retrieve articles through the search engines Academic Search Premier, CINAHLComplete, MEDLINE Complete, PubMed, and Psychology and Behavior Sciences Collection. Findings: In the 38 articles selected for the final review, six categories were discussed: global trends, U.S. overdose education programs with naloxone distribution, barriers to public access of naloxone, political opposition and support, financial impact, and recommendations. After reviewing the findings, gaps in the literature were examined, and nursing implications were acknowledged. Originality and Value: Although many authors have researched and discussed public naloxone distribution, a comprehensive review of the current evidence is useful and necessary to enhance future research, practice, and policy efforts. By discovering significant gaps in the literature and by recognizing opportunities for nursing practice, this literature review provides valuable input for healthcare professionals, public health officials, policymakers, and laypersons to better understand an ethically, politically, and socially complicated public health initiative."
Combining school and family alcohol education: A systematic review of the evidence	"Purpose Äì The purpose of this paper is to map and identify evidence for effective components of combined school and family alcohol education interventions. The paper describes current practice, evaluative evidence of its effects, and highlights specific elements of school and family linked education associated with effective prevention or reduction of alcohol misuse by young people aged 11-18 years. Design/methodology/approach Äì This paper takes the form of a systematic review. Findings Äì The review found evidence of small positive effects for interventions delivered over short and longer term duration and low and higher levels of direct contact with students and families. Family-based elements that correlated with positive effects were targeting information and skills development, family communications, and stricter parental attitudes to alcohol misuse. School-based components which involved life skills and social norms approaches were associated with reductions in risky behaviours. Weaker evidence indicated that peer-led programmes, external delivery agents and linkages of school-based components to community-level change may strengthen combined school and family intervention programmes. Research limitations/implications Äì The heterogeneity of the studies precluded the option to perform meta-analysis. Practical implications Äì There is a need for more focused use of planning and evaluation tools, and especially more explicit articulation of behaviours and/or behavioural determinants targeted; the methods that will be employed and the conceptual basis for the programme design could contribute to deeper understanding amongst the intervention community of how and why impact is or is not achieved. Social implications Äì Few studies provide information on the concepts, assumptions or change objectives that shape programme design. The potential benefits of combining school and family education interventions warrants further exploration. Originality/value Äì The authors believe this is the first review to systematically examine objectives, design and impact of combined school and family alcohol education interventions.

Communicating inherited genetic risk between parent and child: a meta-thematic synthesis.	"OBJECTIVES: Communicating genetic risk is a distressing process for families affected by inherited genetic conditions. This systematic review identifies and explores the challenges faced by parents and their (non)affected or at risk children caused by the (non)disclosure of genetic risk information. DESIGN: Qualitative meta-synthesis and thematic analysis. DATA SOURCES: Ovid databases; Ovid 'in progress', British Nursing Index, Embase, Medline and Psychinfo were combined with searches of EBSCOhost databases; CINAHL and ERIC and Web of science and ZETOC databases using truncations of communication, chronic illness and disease and words relating to family with specific genetic conditions; Cystic Fibrosis, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, Hereditary Non-polyposis Colorectal Cancer, Huntington's Disease, Neurofibromatosis and Sickle Cell Anaemia. This was augmented with free Internet and hand searches and an exploration of the bibliographies of all included papers. REVIEW METHOD: All papers were quality assessed to ascertain their research quality and methodological rigour. RESULTS: A total of 2033 citations were retrieved. Following the removal of duplicates, irrelevant articles and the application of an inclusion criterion, 12 articles remained. A further three papers were omitted due to poor quality leaving nine papers which focussed on the disclosure of genetic information between parent and child (<18 years). Eight papers were qualitative in design and one used a mixed method approach. Thematic synthesis produced four themes that inform the structure of the paper; disclosure, emotions involved in disclosure, desired disclosure and recommendations. CONCLUSION: Disclosure of genetic risk information within families is a highly complex and affective process often resulting in delayed disclosure. This can lead to increased family tensions generated by misunderstanding, blame and secrecy. Early, age appropriate disclosure can better prepare children for future considerations such as care planning and reproductive decision-making. It also contributes to effective coping strategies that promote enhanced adaptation and emotional well being. Early disclosure also reduces parental anxieties concerning disclosure from an unwitting source. Research shows that children and young people want their parents to engage in open and honest discussions about the genetic condition. Therefore to help facilitate effective family communication health professionals should provide family centred care and better emotional and informational support. Copyright ¬© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Communication for Development Interventions in Fragile States: a systematic review	NA
Communication in healthcare interactions in dementia: a systematic review of observational studies	"BACKGROUND: Communication is affected by dementia, even in the early stages. Studies directly observing how patients, companions and healthcare professionals communicate have not yet been reviewed. METHODS: Eight databases were searched, and hand searches of relevant journals and grey literature were performed up to August 2014. Two authors reviewed abstracts independently and collectively reviewed for agreement of inclusion. Findings were narratively synthesized. RESULTS: 23 studies were identified observing: diagnostic, follow up, day center, primary care and research consent interactions. Companions were present in 14 studies. Three themes emerged: emotional impact of diagnosis, level of patient involvement and participant strategies to save face and cope with cognitive impairment. Eight studies observed diagnostic disclosure describing emotional reactions, with professionals using mitigating language and rarely checking patient understanding. Studies reported varying patient involvement, showing marginalization in primary care but not in assessments or diagnostic feedback. Patients used humor and metaphor to compensate for difficulties retrieving information and responding appropriately, suggesting preserved awareness of the pragmatics of interaction. Companion roles fluctuated between patient advocate and professional informant. Professionals encountered challenges adapting to heterogeneous patient groups with varying capabilities and needs. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-companion-professional communication in dementia care raises various ethical questions: how to strike a balance between different communicative needs of patients and companions; clarity versus sensitivity in delivery of the diagnosis; and whether to minimize or expose interactional difficulties and misunderstanding to enrich patient understanding and involvement. Healthcare professionals need guidance in delivering a diagnosis and strategies to optimize patient and companion participation."
Communication interventions for autism spectrum disorder in minimally verbal children.	"Background Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has an estimated prevalence of around 1.7% of the population. People with ASD often also have language difficulties, and about 25% to 30% of children with ASD either fail to develop functional language or are minimally verbal. The ability to communicate effectively is an essential life skill, and difficulties with communication can have a range of adverse outcomes, including poorer academic achievement, behavioural difficulties and reduced quality of life. Historically, most studies have investigated communication interventions for ASD in verbal children. We cannot assume the same interventions will work for minimally verbal children with ASD. Objectives To assess the effects of communication interventions for ASD in minimally verbal children. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase as well as 12 other databases and three trials registers in November 2017. We also checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant reviews, contacting experts in the field as well as authors of identified studies about other potentially relevant ongoing and unpublished studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of communication-focused interventions for children (under 12 years of age) diagnosed with ASD and who are minimally verbal (fewer than 30 functional words or unable to use speech alone to communicate), compared with no treatment, wait-list control or treatment as usual. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Main results This review includes two RCTs (154 children aged 32 months to 11 years) of communication interventions for ASD in minimally verbal children compared with a control group (treatment as usual). One RCT used a verbally based intervention (focused playtime intervention; FPI) administered by parents in the home, whereas the other used an alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) intervention (Picture Exchange Communication System; PECS) administered by teachers in a school setting. Authors' conclusions There is limited evidence that verbally based and ACC interventions improve spoken and non-verbal communication in minimally verbal children with ASD. A substantial number of studies have investigated communication interventions for minimally verbal children with ASD, yet only two studies met inclusion criteria for this review, and we considered the overall quality of the evidence to be very low. In the study that used an AAC intervention, there were significant gains in frequency of PECS use and verbal and non-verbal initiations, but not in expressive vocabulary or social communication immediately postintervention. In the study that investigated a verbally based intervention, there were no significant gains in expressive language postintervention, but children with lower expressive language at the beginning of the study improved more than those with better expressive language at baseline. Neither study investigated adverse events, other communication skills, quality of life or behavioural outcomes. Future RCTs that compare two interventions and include a control group will allow us to better understand treatment effects in the context of spontaneous maturation and will allow further comparison of different interventions as well as the investigation of moderating factors."
Communications in public health emergency preparedness: a systematic review of the literature	"During a public health crisis, public health agencies engage in a variety of public communication efforts to inform the population, encourage the adoption of preventive behaviors, and limit the impact of adverse events. Given the importance of communication to the public in public health emergency preparedness, it is critical to examine the extent to which this field of study has received attention from the scientific community. We conducted a systematic literature review to describe current research in the area of communication to the public in public health emergency preparedness, focusing on the association between sociodemographic and behavioral factors and communication as well as preparedness outcomes. Articles were searched in PubMed and Embase and reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. A total of 131 articles were included for final review. Fifty-three percent of the articles were empirical, of which 74% were population-based studies, and 26% used information environment analysis techniques. None had an experimental study design. Population-based studies were rarely supported by theoretical models and mostly relied on a cross-sectional study design. Consistent results were reported on the association between population socioeconomic factors and public health emergency preparedness communication and preparedness outcomes. Our findings show the need for empirical research to determine what type of communication messages can be effective in achieving preparedness outcomes across various population groups. They suggest that a real-time analysis of the information environment is valuable in knowing what is being communicated to the public and could be used for course correction of public health messages during a crisis."
Communicative aspects of decision aids for localized prostate cancer treatment - A systematic review	"CONTEXT: Despite increasing interest in the development and use of decision aids (DAs) for patients with localized prostate cancer (LPC), little attention has been paid to communicative aspects (CAs) of such tools. OBJECTIVE: To identify DAs for LPC treatment, and review these tools for various CAs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DAs were identified through both published literature (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and PsycINFO; 1990-2018) and online sources, in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Identified DAs were reviewed for the International Patient Decision Aid Standards criteria, and analyzed on CAs, including information presentation, personalization, interaction, information control, accessibility, suitability, and source of information. Nineteen DAs were identified. RESULTS: International Patient Decision Aid Standards scores varied greatly among DAs. Crucially, substantial variations in use of CAs by DAs were identified: (1) few DAs used visual aids to communicate statistical information, (2) none were personalized in terms of outcome probabilities or mode of communication, (3) a minority used interactive methods to elicit patients' values and preferences, (4) most included biased cross tables to compare treatment options, and (5) issues were observed in suitability and accessibility that could hinder implementation in clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Our review suggests that DAs for LPC treatment could be further improved by adding CAs such as personalized outcome predictions and interaction methods to the DAs. Clinicians who are using or developing such tools might therefore consider these CAs in order to enhance patient participation in treatment decision-making. Copyright ¬© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Community boundary spanners as an addition to the health workforce to reach marginalised people: a scoping review of the literature	"BACKGROUND: Health services in high-income countries increasingly recognise the challenge of effectively serving and engaging with marginalised people. Effective engagement with marginalised people is essential to reduce health disparities these populations face. One solution is by tapping into the phenomenon of boundary-spanning people in the community-those who facilitate the flow of ideas, information, activities and relationships across organisation and socio-cultural boundaries. METHODS: A scoping review methodology was applied to peer-reviewed articles to answer the question: ""How do health services identify, recruit and use boundary spanners and what are the outcomes?"" The review was conducted in seven databases with search terms based on community-based boundary spanning, marginalised people and health services. FINDINGS: We identified 422 articles with the screening process resulting in a final set of 30 articles. We identified five types of community-based boundary spanning: navigators, community health workers, lay workers, peer supporters and community entities. These range from strong alignment to the organisation through to those embedded in the community. We found success in four domains for the organisation, the boundary spanner, the marginalised individuals and the broader community. Quantifiable outcomes related to cost-savings, improved disease management and high levels of clinical care. Outcomes for marginalised individuals related to improved health knowledge and behaviours, improved health, social benefits, reduced barriers to accessing services and increased participation in services. We identified potential organisational barriers to using boundary spanners based on organisational culture and staff beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Community boundary spanners are a valuable adjunct to the health workforce. They enable access to hard to reach populations with beneficial health outcomes. Maintaining the balance of organisational and community alignment is key to ongoing success and diffusion of this approach."
Community coalition-driven interventions to reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic minority populations	"BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic disparities in health status are pervasive at all stages of the life cycle. One approach to reducing health disparities involves mobilizing community coalitions that include representatives of target populations to plan and implement interventions for community level change. A systematic examination of coalition-led interventions is needed to inform decision making about the use of community coalition models. OBJECTIVES: To assess effects of community coalition-driven interventions in improving health status or reducing health disparities among racial and ethnic minority populations. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, Social Science Citation Index, Dissertation Abstracts, System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE) (from January 1990 through September 30, 2013), and Global Health Library (from January 1990 through March 31, 2014). SELECTION CRITERIA: Cluster-randomized controlled trials, randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental designs, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series studies, and prospective controlled cohort studies. Only studies of community coalitions with at least one racial or ethnic minority group representing the target population and at least two community public or private organizations are included. Major outcomes of interest are direct measures of health status, as well as lifestyle factors when evidence indicates that these have an effect on the direct measures performed. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for each study. MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-eight community coalition-driven intervention studies were included. No study was considered to be at low risk of bias. Behavioral change outcomes and health status change outcomes were analyzed separately. Outcomes are grouped by intervention type. Pooled effects across intervention types are not presented because the diverse community coalition-led intervention studies did not examine the same constructs or relationships, and they used dissimilar methodological designs. Broad-scale community system level change strategies led to little or no difference in measures of health behavior or health status (very low-certainty evidence). Broad health and social care system level strategies leds to small beneficial changes in measures of health behavior or health status in large samples of community residents (very low-certainty evidence). Lay community health outreach worker interventions led to beneficial changes in health behavior measures of moderate magnitude in large samples of community residents (very low-certainty evidence). Lay community health outreach worker interventions may lead to beneficial changes in health status measures in large samples of community residents; however, results were not consistent across studies (low-certainty evidence). Group-based health education led by professional staff resulted in moderate improvement in measures of health behavior (very low-certainty evidence) or health status (low-certainty evidence). Adverse outcomes of community coalition-led interventions were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Coalition-led interventions are characterized by connection of multi-sectoral networks of health and human service providers with ethnic and racial minority communities. These interventions benefit a diverse range of individual health outcomes and behaviors, as well as health and social care delivery systems. Evidence in this review shows that interventions led by community coalitions may connect health and human service providers with ethnic and racial minority communities in ways that benefit individual health outcomes and behaviors, as well as care delivery systems. However, because information on characteristics of the coalitions themselves is insufficient, evidence does not provide an explanation for the underlying mechanisms of beneficial effects. Thus, a definitive answer as to whether a coalition-led intervention adds extra value to the types of community engagement intervention strategies described in this review remains unattainable."
Community empowerment among female sex workers is an effective HIV prevention intervention: a systematic review of the peer-reviewed evidence from low- and middle-income countries	"We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of community empowerment interventions for HIV prevention among sex workers in low- and middle-income countries from 1990-2010. Two coders abstracted data using standardized forms. Of 6,664 citations screened, ten studies met inclusion criteria. For HIV infection, two observational studies showed a significantly protective combined effect odds ratio (OR): 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.709-0.988]. For STI infection, one longitudinal study showed reduced gonorrhoea/chlamydia (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.26-0.99). Observational studies showed reduced gonorrhoea (OR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.47-0.90), but non-significant effects on chlamydia and syphilis. For condom use, one randomized controlled trial showed improvements with clients (beta: 0.3447, p = 0.002). One longitudinal study showed improvements with regular clients (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.3), but no change with new clients. Observational studies showed improvements with new clients (OR: 3.04, 95% CI: 1.29-7.17), regular clients (OR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.41-3.42), and all clients (OR: 5.87, 95% CI: 2.88-11.94), but not regular non-paying partners. Overall, community empowerment-based HIV prevention was associated with significant improvements across HIV outcomes and settings."
Community health volunteers could help improve access to and use of essential health services by communities in LMICs: an umbrella review.	"A number of primary studies and systematic reviews focused on the contribution of community health workers (CHWs) in the delivery of essential health services. In many countries, a cadre of informal health workers also provide services on a volunteer basis community health volunteers (CHV)], but there has been no synthesis of studies investigating their role and potential contribution across a range of health conditions; most existing studies are narrowly focused on a single condition. As this cadre grows in importance, there is a need to examine the evidence on whether and how CHVs can improve access to and use of essential health services in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We report an umbrella review of systematic reviews, searching PubMed, the Cochrane library, the database of abstracts of reviews of effects (DARE), EMBASE, ProQuest dissertation and theses, the Campbell library and DOPHER. We considered a review as 'systematic' if it had an explicit search strategy with qualitative or quantitative summaries of data. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal assessment checklist to assess methodological quality. A data extraction format prepared a priori was used to extract data. Findings were synthesized narratively. Of 422 records initially found by the search strategy, we identified 39 systematic reviews eligible for inclusion. Most concluded that services provided by CHVs were not inferior to those provided by other health workers, and sometimes better. However, CHVs performed less well in more complex tasks such as diagnosis and counselling. Their performance could be strengthened by regular supportive supervision, in-service training and adequate logistical support, as well as a high level of community ownership. The use of CHVs in the delivery of selected health services for population groups with limited access, particularly in LMICs, appears promising. However, success requires careful implementation, strong policy backing and continual support by their managers. Copyright ¬© The Author(s) 2018.

"Community involvement in design, implementation and evaluation of nutrition interventions to reduce chronic diseases in indigenous populations in the U.S.: a systematic review"	"BACKGROUND: Indigenous peoples of the United States disproportionately experience chronic diseases associated with poor nutrition, including obesity and diabetes. While chronic disease related health disparities among Indigenous people are well documented, it is unknown whether interventions adequately address these health disparities. In addition, it is unknown whether and to what extent interventions are culturally adapted or tailored to the unique culture, worldview and nutrition environments of Indigenous people. The aim of this review was to identify and characterize nutrition interventions conducted with Indigenous populations in the US, and to determine whether and to what degree communities are involved in intervention design, implementation and evaluation. METHODS: Peer-reviewed articles were identified using MEDLINE. Articles included were published in English in a refereed journal between 2000 and 2015, reported on a diet-related intervention in Indigenous populations in the US, and reported outcome data. Data extracted were program objectives and activities, target population, geographic region, formative research to inform design and evaluation, partnership, capacity building, involvement of the local food system, and outcomes. Narrative synthesis of intervention characteristics and the degree and type of community involvement was performed. RESULTS: Of 1060 records identified, 49 studies were included. Overall, interventions were successful in producing changes in knowledge, behavior or health (79%). Interventions mostly targeted adults in the Western region and used a pre-test, post-test design. Involvement of communities in intervention design, implementation, and evaluation varied from not at all to involvement at all stages. Of programs reporting significant changes in outcomes, more than half used at least three strategies to engage communities. However, formative research to inform the evaluation was not performed to a great degree, and fewer than half of the programs identified described involvement of the local food system. CONCLUSIONS: The extent of use of strategies to promote community engagement in programs reporting significant outcomes is notable. In planning interventions in Indigenous groups, researchers should consider ways to involve the community in intervention design, execution and evaluation. There is a particular need for studies focused on Indigenous youth in diverse regions of the US to further address diet-related chronic conditions."
Community midwifery initiatives in fragile and conflict-affected countries: a scoping review of approaches from recruitment to retention	"BACKGROUND: Birth assisted by skilled health workers is one of the most effective interventions for reducing maternal and neonatal mortality. Fragile and conflict-affected states and situations (FCAS), with one-third of global maternal deaths, face significant challenges in achieving skilled care at birth, particularly in health workforce development. The importance of community-level midwifery services to improve skilled care is internationally recognized, but the literature on FCAS is limited. This review aimed to examine community midwifery (CMW) approaches, from recruitment to retention, in FCAS. METHODS: This scoping review design adapted Arksey and O'Malley's six-stage framework. Data collection included systematic searching of seven databases, purposive hand-searching of reference lists and web sites, and stakeholder engagement for additional information. Potential sources were screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included sources were appraised for methodological quality using the McGill University Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Data were analysed thematically, using deductive (i.e. cadre definition, recruitment, education, deployment and retention) and inductive coding (i.e. capacity, gender and insecurity). RESULTS: Twenty-three sources were included, of 2729 identified, discussing community midwifery programmes in six FCAS (i.e. eight for Sudan, six for Afghanistan, three each for Mali and Yemen, two for South Sudan and one for Somalia). Source quality was relatively poor, and cadre definitions were context dependent. Major enablers for effective CMW programmes were community linkages and acceptance, while barriers included inappropriate recruitment, non-standardized education, weak supportive environment, political insecurity and violence. CONCLUSIONS: While community engagement and acceptance were crucial, CMW programmes were weakened by inappropriate recruitment and training, lack of support and general insecurity. Further research and implementation evidence is needed to aid policy-makers, donors and implementing agencies in developing and implementing effective CMW programmes in FCAS.

"Community participation in general health initiatives in high and upper-middle income countries: A systematic review exploring the nature of participation, use of theories, contextual drivers and power relations in community participation."	"Community participation is commonly regarded as pivotal in enabling the success of many health initiatives. However, the theoretical constructs, and evidence about the contextual drivers and relational issues that shape participation is lacking. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the evidence for published academic literature on community participation in relation to general, non-disease specific health initiatives, including the use of theories to inform community participation, and the study of contextual drivers and relational issues that influence community participation, with a focus on high and upper-middle income countries. We searched multiple databases including Medline, Embase, Scopus, LILACs and Global Health from January 2000 to September 2016. We screened papers for inclusion, then conducted data extraction and a narrative synthesis of the data. Only papers that focused on general health were included. Disease-specific literature was excluded. 27,232 records were identified, with 23,468 after duplicate removal. 79 papers met our final inclusion criteria. Overall, our findings show that strategies to encourage community participation in health initiatives can be categorized along a continuum that varies from less to more participation and control among the community. Our analysis of reported outcomes demonstrates that community participation in general health initiatives can contribute to positive process, social and health outcomes. Social outcomes are more often associated with increasing community participation in our selection of papers. Overall, our findings reaffirm the understanding that community participation is a complex process that is strongly influenced by the context in which it occurs, and that social factors such as power relations must be carefully considered. There is a need for more robustly designed studies to improve the theorization of community participation, and to draw out a better understanding of how tangible and intangible elements such as power, influence community participation and its outcomes.

Community participation in Health Impact Assessment. A scoping review of the literature	"Currently, the engagement of local communities in Health Impact Assessment is becoming more and more important. A scoping review was performed to take stock of visions, methods and experiences in this field. A combined Scopus and Medline search yielded 100 articles in scientific journals. The final selection consisted of 43 papers, including case studies, evaluation studies, reviews, and opinion papers. After analysis, consultation of four experts was performed to check preliminary study outcomes. A grey literature web search was performed to check and complement the results. Results show that community participation is generally considered a core element in HIA. Views as expressed in the papers concern, firstly, the need for and value of local knowledge, secondly, the adherence to or application of democratic values and, thirdly, empowerment of communities. Three categories of methods are used in relation to community participation, often in combination: methods to facilitate knowledge elicitation, to ensure the inclusion of communities in the HIA process, and to build community capacity to participate in policy development. However, the theoretical or practical underpinning of the choice for specific methods is mostly not presented. The experiences described in the papers mainly focus on the access to local knowledge and its usability as a source of evidence in the HIA process. Described effects of community participation are (improved) relations between communities and local agencies, policy makers and professionals and the empowerment of community members. Although these effects are ascribed to community participation, many papers do not provide support for this conclusion beyond the retrospective perception of participants. Expert consultation and additional analysis of the grey literature supported the results derived from the scientific literature and provided more in-depth knowledge. In the grey literature theoretical frameworks, methods and tools for community participation in HIA were more extensively reported as compared to the scientific literature. We conclude that the visions, methods and experiences concerning community participation show that a participative approach may contribute to better, context specific knowledge. It appears that participative HIA has health promotion potential as it helps develop responsive policies. To accomplish this, HIA should, firstly, be better embedded in broader health promotion programmes. Secondly, the methods and approaches for community participation applied in HIA should be theory-informed and well described. The grey literature offers entry points. Finally, more robust and systematic evaluation and research is needed to assess the impact of HIAs on communities and policies."
"Community participation in health services development, implementation, and evaluation: A systematic review of empowerment, health, community, and process outcomes."	"BACKGROUND: Community participation is widely believed to be beneficial to the development, implementation and evaluation of health services. However, many challenges to successful and sustainable community involvement remain. Importantly, there is little evidence on the effect of community participation in terms of outcomes at both the community and individual level. Our systematic review seeks to examine the evidence on outcomes of community participation in high and upper-middle income countries. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This review was developed according to PRISMA guidelines. Eligible studies included those that involved the community, service users, consumers, households, patients, public and their representatives in the development, implementation, and evaluation of health services, policy or interventions. We searched the following databases from January 2000 to September 2016: Medline, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, and LILACs. We independently screened articles for inclusion, conducted data extraction, and assessed studies for risk of bias. No language restrictions were made. 27,232 records were identified, with 23,468 after removal of duplicates. Following titles and abstracts screening, 49 met the inclusion criteria for this review. A narrative synthesis of the findings was conducted. Outcomes were categorised as process outcomes, community outcomes, health outcomes, empowerment and stakeholder perspectives. Our review reports a breadth of evidence that community involvement has a positive impact on health, particularly when substantiated by strong organisational and community processes. This is in line with the notion that participatory approaches and positive outcomes including community empowerment and health improvements do not occur in a linear progression, but instead consists of complex processes influenced by an array of social and cultural factors. CONCLUSION: This review adds to the evidence base supporting the effectiveness of community participation in yielding positive outcomes at the organizational, community and individual level. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Prospero record number: CRD42016048244."
"Community Participation in Health Systems Research: A Systematic Review Assessing the State of Research, the Nature of Interventions Involved and the Features of Engagement with Communities"	"BACKGROUND: Community participation is a major principle of people centered health systems, with considerable research highlighting its intrinsic value and strategic importance. Existing reviews largely focus on the effectiveness of community participation with less attention to how community participation is supported in health systems intervention research. OBJECTIVE: To explore the extent, nature and quality of community participation in health systems intervention research in low- and middle-income countries. METHODOLOGY: We searched for peer-reviewed, English language literature published between January 2000 and May 2012 through four electronic databases. Search terms combined the concepts of community, capability/participation, health systems research and low- and middle-income countries. The initial search yielded 3,092 articles, of which 260 articles with more than nominal community participation were identified and included. We further excluded 104 articles due to lower levels of community participation across the research cycle and poor description of the process of community participation. Out of the remaining 160 articles with rich community participation, we further examined 64 articles focused on service delivery and governance within health systems research. RESULTS: Most articles were led by authors in high income countries and many did not consistently list critical aspects of study quality. Articles were most likely to describe community participation in health promotion interventions (78%, 202/260), even though they were less participatory than other health systems areas. Community involvement in governance and supply chain management was less common (12%, 30/260 and 9%, 24/260 respectively), but more participatory. Articles cut across all health conditions and varied by scale and duration, with those that were implemented at national scale or over more than five years being mainstreamed by government. Most articles detailed improvements in service availability, accessibility and acceptability, with fewer efforts focused on quality, and few designs able to measure impact on health outcomes. With regards to participation, most articles supported community's in implementing interventions (95%, n = 247/260), in contrast to involving communities in identifying and defining problems (18%, n = 46/260). Many articles did not discuss who in communities participated, with just over a half of the articles disaggregating any information by sex. Articles were largely under theorized, and only five mentioned power or control. Majority of the articles (57/64) described community participation processes as being collaborative with fewer describing either community mobilization or community empowerment. Intrinsic individual motivations, community-level trust, strong external linkages, and supportive institutional processes facilitated community participation, while lack of training, interest and information, along with weak financial sustainability were challenges. Supportive contextual factors included decentralization reforms and engagement with social movements. CONCLUSION: Despite positive examples, community participation in health systems interventions was variable, with few being truly community directed. Future research should more thoroughly engage with community participation theory, recognize the power relations inherent in community participation, and be more realistic as to how much communities can participate and cognizant of who decides that."
Community participation in research from resource-constrained countries: a scoping review	"Participatory health research (PHR) involves equitable community participation in all aspects of the research process. It is a potentially beneficial approach to research in resource-constrained countries. Measuring participation in specific activities and aspects is necessary for understanding the community and research-related benefits of PHR. The aims of this scoping review were to: develop a measure of lay-community participation in aspects and activities of PHR in resource-constrained countries; and use the measure to assess the nature and extent of reported participation. Directed content analysis was used to identify aspects and activities reported in peer-reviewed articles identified through a systematic search, develop the Comprehensive Community Participation in Research Framework (CCPRF) and use it to measure participation. Total and aspect participation scores, which considered both the nature and extent of participation, were calculated for articles reporting extensive participation. Eighty-five articles detailing 66 studies were included. Nine aspects and 49 activities of research were included in the CCPRF. Community participation was reported in a median of 5/9 (range 1-9) aspects and 8/49 (range 1-35) activities. The review provided diverse examples, and enabled development of a more comprehensive measure, of participation. It highlighted limited lay-community participation is reported in research labelled participatory from resource-constrained countries. As participation in all aspects of PHR is rarely achieved, strategic planning of more limited participation is imperative. More detailed and systematic planning, assessment and reporting of participation, guided by a comprehensive measure like the CCPRF, is required to develop evidence regarding the benefits of participation in various research activities."
Community participation in rural health: a scoping review	"BACKGROUND: Major health inequities between urban and rural populations have resulted in rural health as a reform priority across a number of countries. However, while there is some commonality between rural areas, there is increasing recognition that a one size fits all approach to rural health is ineffective as it fails to align healthcare with local population need. Community participation is proposed as a strategy to engage communities in developing locally responsive healthcare. Current policy in several countries reflects a desire for meaningful, high level community participation, similar to Arnstein's definition of citizen power. There is a significant gap in understanding how higher level community participation is best enacted in the rural context. The aim of our study was to identify examples, in the international literature, of higher level community participation in rural healthcare. METHODS: A scoping review was designed to map the existing evidence base on higher level community participation in rural healthcare planning, design, management and evaluation. Key search terms were developed and mapped. Selected databases and internet search engines were used that identified 99 relevant studies. RESULTS: We identified six articles that most closely demonstrated higher level community participation; Arnstein's notion of citizen power. While the identified studies reflected key elements for effective higher level participation, little detail was provided about how groups were established and how the community was represented. The need for strong partnerships was reiterated, with some studies identifying the impact of relational interactions and social ties. In all studies, outcomes from community participation were not rigorously measured. CONCLUSIONS: In an environment characterised by increasing interest in community participation in healthcare, greater understanding of the purpose, process and outcomes is a priority for research, policy and practice."
Community participation interventions for children and adolescents with a neurodevelopmental intellectual disability: a systematic review	"PURPOSE: The purpose of this review was to examine the effectiveness of community integration interventions in facilitating the community participation, self-esteem, and quality of life of children and adolescent's with a neurodevelopmental intellectual disability. METHODS: Electronic searches of five databases and manual searches of reference lists were conducted. Community integration interventions which targeted friendship development, recreation participation, quality of life, and self-esteem were included. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in this review. A variety of study designs and interventions were used. All but one study reported significantly increased friendships, five studies reported increased recreation participation and one study reported increased quality of life and self-esteem. Methodological quality of the studies ranged from adequate to strong. CONCLUSIONS: Community integration interventions appear to be effective in enhancing the inclusion of children and adolescents with a neurodevelopmental intellectual disability. In particular, findings from this review highlight that there are potentially many ways to continue to improve the effectiveness of community participation interventions for this group. These include the need for the development of programmes which facilitate friendships alongside recreational participation, include typically developing peers, consider the activity preferences of children and adolescents in developing programmes, and accommodate individual impairments and needs through grading and adaptive leisure activities. Future interventions should use the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health as a measurement framework and consider the role of factors such as impairment, personal and environmental factors in facilitating community participation."
Community-academic partnerships in HIV-related research: a systematic literature review of theory and practice	"INTRODUCTION: Community involvement in HIV research has increased over recent years, enhancing community-academic partnerships. Several terms have been used to describe community participation in research. Clarification is needed to determine whether these terms are synonymous or actually describe different research processes. In addition, it remains unclear if the role that communities play in the actual research process follows the recommendations given in theoretical frameworks of community-academia research. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to review the existing terms and definitions regarding community-academic partnerships and assess how studies are implementing these in relation to conceptual definitions. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed. Two reviewers independently assessed each article, applying the following inclusion criteria: the article must be published in English before 2013; it must provide an explicit definition and/or defining methodology for a term describing research with a community component; and it has to refer to HIV or AIDS, reproductive health and/or STDs. When disagreements about the relevance of an article emerged, a third reviewer was involved until concordance was reached. Data were extracted by one reviewer and independently verified by a second. Qualitative data were analyzed using MaxQDA for content and thematic analyses while quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Community feedback on data analysis and presentation of results was also incorporated. RESULTS: In total, 246 articles were retrieved, 159 of which fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The number of studies that included community participation in the field of HIV research increased between 1991 and 2012, and the terms used to describe these activities have changed, moving away from action research (AR) to participatory action research (PAR), community-based research (CBR) and community-based participatory research (CBPR), with the latter being the most commonly used term. While definitions of all terms had common characteristics (e.g. participation of community in research process), they varied with regard to the emphasis placed on these characteristics. The nature of community participation in reviewed studies differed considerably from that described in theoretical models. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates the increase of participatory approaches in HIV research and underlines the need for clarification of terms and a framework providing orientation to community-academia partnerships."
Community-based organizations in the health sector: a scoping review	"Community-based organizations are important health system stakeholders as they provide numerous, often highly valued programs and services to the members of their community. However, community-based organizations are described using diverse terminology and concepts from across a range of disciplines. To better understand the literature related to community-based organizations in the health sector (i.e., those working in health systems or more broadly to address population or public health issues), we conducted a scoping review by using an iterative process to identify existing literature, conceptually map it, and identify gaps and areas for future inquiry.We searched 18 databases and conducted citation searches using 15 articles to identify relevant literature. All search results were reviewed in duplicate and were included if they addressed the key characteristics of community-based organizations or networks of community-based organizations. We then coded all included articles based on the country focus, type of literature, source of literature, academic discipline, disease sector, terminology used to describe organizations and topics discussed. We identified 186 articles addressing topics related to the key characteristics of community-based organizations and/or networks of community-based organizations. The literature is largely focused on high-income countries and on mental health and addictions, HIV/AIDS or general/unspecified populations. A large number of different terms have been used in the literature to describe community-based organizations and the literature addresses a range of topics about them (mandate, structure, revenue sources and type and skills or skill mix of staff), the involvement of community members in organizations, how organizations contribute to community organizing and development and how they function in networks with each other and with government (e.g., in policy networks).Given the range of terms used to describe community-based organizations, this scoping review can be used to further map their meanings/definitions to develop a more comprehensive typology and understanding of community-based organizations. This information can be used in further investigations about the ways in which community-based organizations can be engaged in health system decision-making and the mechanisms available for facilitating or supporting their engagement."
Community-based surveillance: A scoping review.	"BACKGROUND: Involving community members in identifying and reporting health events for public health surveillance purposes, an approach commonly described as community-based surveillance (CBS), is increasingly gaining interest. We conducted a scoping review to list terms and definitions used to characterize CBS, to identify and summarize available guidance and recommendations, and to map information on past and existing in-country CBS systems. METHODS: We searched eight bibliographic databases and screened the worldwide web for any document mentioning an approach in which community members both collected and reported information on health events from their community for public health surveillance. Two independent reviewers performed double blind screening and data collection, any discrepancy was solved through discussion and consensus. FINDINGS: From the 134 included documents, several terms and definitions for CBS were retrieved. Guidance and recommendations for CBS were scattered through seven major guides and sixteen additional documents. Seventy-nine unique CBS systems implemented since 1958 in 42 countries were identified, mostly implemented in low and lower-middle income countries (79%). The systems appeared as fragmented (81% covering a limited geographical area and 70% solely implemented in a rural setting), vertical (67% with a single scope of interest), and of limited duration (median of 6 years for ongoing systems and 2 years for ended systems). Collection of information was mostly performed by recruited community members (80%). INTERPRETATION: While CBS has already been implemented in many countries, standardization is still required on the term and processes to be used. Further research is needed to ensure CBS integrates effectively into the overall public health surveillance system."
"Community-engaged interventions on diet, activity, and weight outcomes in U.S. schools: a systematic review"	"CONTEXT: Community engagement literature suggests that capacity-building approaches and community partnership in health intervention design, delivery, and analysis improve outcomes. School communities influence childhood diet and activity patterns affecting lifelong obesity risk. This systematic review's purpose is to assess whether incorporating community engagement principles in school-based interventions influences weight-related outcomes. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Obesity-prevention interventions (published January 2000-2011) in diverse U.S. schools, meeting a minimum threshold of community engagement and targeting weight-, diet- or activity-related outcomes were identified in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL (December 2010-March 2011). Two reviewers scored community engagement performance on 24 metrics of capacity building and partner involvement along four research stages. Outcome performance was calculated as percentage of targeted primary and/or secondary outcomes achieved. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Sixteen studies were included, targeting anthropometric (n = 12); dietary (n = 13); and activity (n = 10) outcomes in schoolchildren (mean age=10.7 years). Studies averaged 46% of targeted outcomes (95% CI = 0.33, 0.60) and met 60% of community engagement metrics. Positive correlations existed between community engagement performance and all-outcome performance (r = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.25, 0.87) and secondary-outcome performance (r = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.22, 0.89), but not primary-outcome performance (r = 0.26, 95% CI = -0.27, 0.67). Number of outcomes met was not correlated with number of outcomes targeted, number of partners, or study size. Specific qualitative and quantitative trends suggested that capacity-building efforts, engagement in needs assessments and results dissemination, and durable partnerships positively influence outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that meaningful partnership of diverse school communities within obesity prevention interventions can improve health outcomes.

Community-engaged research for the enhancement of diabetes prevention interventions among Hispanic Americans: A systematic review	"Hispanic Americans are at a high risk for diabetes, prompting a need for targeted interventions. Community-engaged research (CEnR) methods are recommended in efforts to address health disparities in minority populations. However, it is unclear to what extent researchers in this area use CEnR framework to guide their work. In this exploratory evaluation, we seek to assess the relevant published literature for the outcomes of diabetes prevention programs among at-risk Hispanic Americans and the presence of CEnR components in these programs. We further explore whether the number of CEnR components is associated with intervention outcomes including weight change, intervention participant engagement, and study retention. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and LILACS for relevant articles from 2002 to 2016 in English language. Two members of the research team screened all articles. Seven studies (5 RCTs, 2 prospective trials) met eligibility criteria. Significant improvements were reported for several measures of body composition including weight, BMI, and waist circumference. Small or insignificant changes were reported for measures of glucose control. Mixed results were found for psychosocial and behavioral outcomes. The CEnR elements most often utilized were implementation in a community setting (100%), and collaborating with community members in partnerships and advisory committees (86%), in cultural intervention tailoring (86%) and in program delivery (71%). Studies were generally limited in several key areas of CEnR including data analysis (14%), dissemination of results (14%), choosing a research focus (14%), and data collection (0%). However, we found no statistical relationship between our CeNR composite variable and weight change (R2=0.0), insufficient data to report on CeNR and study participation, and a moderate negative relationship between CeNR and retention (R2=-0.53). However, further research is needed to confirm these results. This paper demonstrates the variability of both the use and description of CEnR components within the literature. These findings support the need for consensus guidelines on best practices for reporting of CEnR components. Once established, further research can investigate the association between CEnR and research process and outcome measures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
Community-led and/or focused initiatives to support family carers within a palliative care context: An integrative review.	Background: Public health approaches to palliative care prioritise community-focused initiatives to support people with palliative care needs and their families. The nature and extent of these initiatives have not previously been reported.
"Comparison of national health research priority-setting methods and characteristics in Latin America and the Caribbean, 2002-2012"	"Objective. To compare health research priority-setting methods and characteristics among countries in Latin America and the Caribbean during 2002-2012. Methods. This was a systematic review that identified national health research policies and priority agendas through a search of ministry and government databases related to health care institutions. PubMed, LILACS, the Health Research Web, and others were searched for the period from January 2002-February 2012. The study excluded research organized by governmental institutions and specific national strategies on particular disease areas. Priority-setting methods were compared to the ""nine common themes for good practice in health research priorities."" National health research priorities were compared to those of the World Health Organization's Millennium Development Goals (MDG). Results. Of the 18 Latin American countries assessed, 13 had documents that established national health research priorities; plus the Caribbean Health Research Council had a research agenda for its 19 constituents. These 14 total reports varied widely in terms of objectives, content, dissemination, and implementation; most provided a list of strategic areas, suggestions, and/or sub-priorities for each country; however, few proposed specific research topics and questions. Conclusions. Future reports could be improved by including more details on the comprehensive approach employed to identify priorities, on the information gathering process, and on practices to be undertaken after priorities are set. There is a need for improving the quality of the methodologies utilized and coordinating Regional efforts as countries strive to meet the MDG.; Objetivo.

Concepts and measures of patient empowerment: a comprehensive review	NA
Conceptualizing 20 years of engaged scholarship: A scoping review	"Engaged scholarship, a movement that has been growing steadily since 1995, offers a new way of bridging gaps between the university and civil society. Numerous papers and reports have been published since Boyer's foundational discourse in 1996. Yet, beyond a growing interest in orienting universities' missions, we observed a lack a formal definition and conceptualization of this movement. Based on a scoping review of the literature over the past 20 years, the objective of this article is to propose a conceptualization of engaged scholarship. More specifically, we define its values, principles, and processes. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this new posture for faculty and students, as well as for the university as an institution."
Congregation-based programs to address HIV/AIDS: elements of successful implementation	"Religious organizations may be uniquely positioned to address HIV by offering prevention, treatment, or support services to affected populations, but models of effective congregation-based HIV programs in the literature are scarce. This systematic review distils lessons on successfully implementing congregation HIV efforts. Peer-reviewed articles on congregation-based HIV efforts were reviewed against criteria measuring the extent of collaboration, tailoring to the local context, and use of community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods. The effectiveness of congregations' efforts and their capacity to overcome barriers to addressing HIV is also assessed. We found that most congregational efforts focused primarily on HIV prevention, were developed in partnerships with outside organizations and tailored to target audiences, and used CBPR methods. A few more comprehensive programs also provided care and support to people with HIV and/or addressed substance use and mental health needs. We also found that congregational barriers such as HIV stigma and lack of understanding HIV's importance were overcome using various strategies including tailoring programs to be respectful of church doctrine and campaigns to inform clergy and congregations. However, efforts to confront stigma directly were rare, suggesting a need for further research."
Congruence between patients' preferred and perceived participation in medical decision-making: a review of the literature	"BACKGROUND: Patients are increasingly expected and asked to be involved in health care decisions. In this decision-making process, preferences for participation are important. In this systematic review we aim to provide an overview the literature related to the congruence between patients' preferences and their perceived participation in medical decision-making. We also explore the direction of mismatched and outline factors associated with congruence. METHODS: A systematic review was performed on patient participation in medical decision-making. Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library databases up to September 2012, were searched and all studies were rigorously critically appraised. In total 44 papers were included, they sampled contained 52 different patient samples. RESULTS: Mean of congruence between preference for and perceived participation in decision-making was 60% (49 and 70 representing 25th and 75th percentiles). If no congruence was found, of 36 patient samples most patients preferred more involvement and of 9 patient samples most patients preferred less involvement. Factors associated with preferences the most investigated were age and educational level. Younger patients preferred more often an active or shared role as did higher educated patients. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that a similar approach to all patients is not likely to meet patients' wishes, since preferences for participation vary among patients. Health care professionals should be sensitive to patients individual preferences and communicate about patients' participation wishes on a regular basis during their illness trajectory."
Consumer involvement in systematic reviews of comparative effectiveness research.	"BACKGROUND: The Institute of Medicine recently recommended that comparative effectiveness research (CER) should involve input from consumers. While systematic reviews are a major component of CER, little is known about consumer involvement. OBJECTIVE: To explore current approaches to involving consumers in US-based and key international organizations and groups conducting or commissioning systematic reviews ('organizations'). DESIGN: In-depth, semi-structured interviews with key informants and review of organizations' websites. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen highly regarded US-based and international (Cochrane Collaboration, Campbell Collaboration) organizations. RESULTS: Organizations that usually involve consumers (seven of 17 in our sample) involve them at a programmatic level in the organization or in individual reviews through one-time consultation or on-going collaboration. For example, consumers may suggest topics, provide input on the key questions of the review, provide comments on draft protocols and reports, serve as co-authors or on an advisory group. Organizations involve different types of consumers (individual patients, consumer advocates, families and caregivers), recruiting them mainly through patient organizations and consumer networks. Some offer training in research methods, and one developed training for researchers on how to involve consumers. Little formal evaluation of the effects of consumer involvement is being carried out. CONCLUSIONS: Consumers are currently involved in systematic reviews in a variety of ways and for various reasons. Assessing which approaches are most effective in achieving different aims of consumer involvement is now required to inform future recommendations on consumer involvement in CER.

Consumer involvement in the tertiary-level education of mental health professionals: a systematic review	"A systematic review of the published work on consumer involvement in the education of health professionals was undertaken using the PRISMA guidelines. Searches of the CINAHL, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO electronic databases returned 487 records, and 20 met the inclusion criteria. Further papers were obtained through scanning the reference lists of those articles included from the initial published work search (n = 9) and contacting researchers in the field (n = 1). Thirty papers (representing 28 studies) were included in this review. Findings from three studies indicate that consumer involvement in the education of mental health professionals is limited and variable across professions. Evaluations of consumer involvement in 16 courses suggest that students gain insight into consumers' perspectives of: (i) what life is like for people with mental illness; (ii) mental illness itself; (iii) the experiences of admission to, and treatment within, mental health services; and (iv) how these services could be improved. Some students and educators, however, raised numerous concerns about consumer involvement in education (e.g. whether consumers were pursuing their own agendas, whether consumers' views were representative). Evaluations of consumer involvement in education are limited in that their main focus is on the perceptions of students. The findings of this review suggest that public policy expectations regarding consumer involvement in mental health services appear to be slowly affecting the education of mental health professionals. Future research needs to focus on determining the effect of consumer involvement in education on the behaviours and attitudes of students in healthcare environments.

Consumer participation and organizational development in health care: a systematic review	"OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of published data on user participation in Health Care. BACKGROUND: Active and passive involvement of consumers into agendas associated with Health Care is still an exception. Data on the success of user participation projects in various areas of Health Care are lacking. DESIGN: Systematic literature review using public databases. RESULTS: We identified 467 studies including five systematic reviews describing various participation projects, among them workshops, citizens' panels, focus groups, citizens' juries, and consultation meetings. A general trend favoring a specific method was not observed. The categorization of evaluable studies according to Health Care area (n = 331) yielded the following results: general medicine/preventive medicine (n = 5), internal medicine/oncology (n = 132), obstetrics and gynecology (n = 2), surgery (n = 1), neurology/psychiatry (n = 2), social medicine (n = 16), health worker training (n = 38), and research agenda setting (n = 135). Predefined qualitative parameters were extracted from 69/467 (15%) studies. Sixty one of 69 studies (88%) were retrospective analyses without control groups and without outcome assessment. Six studies had outcome assessment, three judged the outcome as successful, two as negative, and one multi-project study reported 'very successful' project assessments in 24% of the projects. In 18 studies, the level of consumer participation was described as 'informed' in 2/18, 'advisory' in 14/18, and 'decision-making' in 2/18. The following factors associated with project success were identified: adequate financing, partnerships with well institutionalized consumer organizations, advanced project logistics, small-scale projects, and adequate internal and external communication. CONCLUSIONS: Most consumer participation projects were performed in research agenda setting, internal medicine/oncology, and health worker training. Various methods have been used in the projects, the level of consumer participation was low, and the success rate of the investigated projects was moderate. Potential factors associated with project success and future areas of research are discussed."
Consumer participation in drug treatment: a systematic review	"Purpose It is unclear how consumer participation (CP) can be optimised to transform drug and alcohol treatment services and improve health outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to present the findings of a systematic review examining the types and benefits of activities, and the factors that facilitate CP in drug treatment services.Design/methodology/approach A structured search of four databases was undertaken to identify peer reviewed primary research literature in English. Screened articles were appraised. A content analysis was applied to examine the types and outcomes of CP and the associated factors affecting the process. In total, 16 articles were included for review.Findings A range of CP activities were identified, and benefits included increased consumer satisfaction, and improved health service delivery. Factors that facilitated the process of CP included positive attitudes of both consumers and providers and employment of people with a lived experience of drug use. However, the lack of consumer and organisational capacity, negative attitudes of providers and power imbalances between consumers and providers constrained CP efforts.Practical implications To maximise the benefits of CP in drug and alcohol treatment services, negative attitudes about CP and power dynamics between consumers and health providers need to be addressed. This can be achieved by the strategic use of strengths-based interventions and consumer led education to enhance social capital.Originality/value This is the first known review to examine the benefits and facilitators of CP in drug treatment services."
Consumer participation in early detection of the deteriorating patient and call activation to rapid response systems: a literature review	"Aims and objectives. This review investigated the impact of consumer participation in recognition of patient deterioration and response through call activation in rapid response systems. Background. Nurses and doctors have taken the main role in recognition and response to patient deterioration through hospital rapid response systems. Yet patients and visitors (consumers) have appeared well placed to notice early signs of deterioration. In response, many hospitals have sought to partner health professionals with consumers in detection and response to early deterioration. However, to date, there have been no published research-based reviews to establish the impact of introducing consumer involvement into rapid response systems. Design. A critical research-based review was undertaken. Methods. A comprehensive search of databases from 2006-2014 identified 11 studies. Critical appraisal of these studies was undertaken and thematic analysis of the findings revealed four major themes. Results. Following implementation of the consumer activation programmes, the number of calls made by the consumers following detection of deterioration increased. Interestingly, the number of staff calls also increased. Importantly, mortality numbers were found to decrease in one major study following the introduction of consumer call activation. Consumer and staff knowledge and satisfaction with the new programmes indicated mixed results. Initial concerns of the staff over consumer involvement overwhelming the rapid response systems did not eventuate. Evaluation of successful consumer-activated programmes indicated the importance of: effective staff education and training; ongoing consumer education by nurses and clear educational materials. Conclusions. Findings indicated positive patient outcomes following introduction of consumer call activation programmes within rapid response systems. Effective consumer programmes included information that was readily accessible, easy-to-understand and available in a range of multimedia materials accompanied by the explanation and support of health professionals. Relevance to clinical practice. Introduction of consumer-activated programmes within rapid response systems appears likely to improve outcomes for patients experiencing deterioration."
Consumer Perspective on Personal Health Records: A Review of the Literature	NA
Consumer-providers of care for adult clients of statutory mental health services	"BACKGROUND: In mental health services, the past several decades has seen a slow but steady trend towards employment of past or present consumers of the service to work alongside mental health professionals in providing services. However the effects of this employment on clients (service recipients) and services has remained unclear.We conducted a systematic review of randomised trials assessing the effects of employing consumers of mental health services as providers of statutory mental health services to clients. In this review this role is called 'consumer-provider' and the term 'statutory mental health services' refers to public services, those required by statute or law, or public services involving statutory duties. The consumer-provider's role can encompass peer support, coaching, advocacy, case management or outreach, crisis worker or assertive community treatment worker, or providing social support programmes. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of employing current or past adult consumers of mental health services as providers of statutory mental health services. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 3), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1950 to March 2012), EMBASE (OvidSP) (1988 to March 2012), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to March 2012), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (1981 to March 2009), Current Contents (OvidSP) (1993 to March 2012), and reference lists of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of current or past consumers of mental health services employed as providers ('consumer-providers') in statutory mental health services, comparing either: 1) consumers versus professionals employed to do the same role within a mental health service, or 2) mental health services with and without consumer-providers as an adjunct to the service. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. We contacted trialists for additional information. We conducted analyses using a random-effects model, pooling studies that measured the same outcome to provide a summary estimate of the effect across studies. We describe findings for each outcome in the text of the review with considerations of the potential impact of bias and the clinical importance of results, with input from a clinical expert. MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 randomised controlled trials involving 2796 people. The quality of these studies was moderate to low, with most of the studies at unclear risk of bias in terms of random sequence generation and allocation concealment, and high risk of bias for blinded outcome assessment and selective outcome reporting.Five trials involving 581 people compared consumer-providers to professionals in similar roles within mental health services (case management roles (4 trials), facilitating group therapy (1 trial)). There were no significant differences in client quality of life (mean difference (MD) -0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.80 to 0.20); depression (data not pooled), general mental health symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.24, 95% CI -0.52 to 0.05); client satisfaction with treatment (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.69 to 0.25), client or professional ratings of client-manager relationship; use of mental health services, hospital admissions and length of stay; or attrition (risk ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.09) between mental health teams involving consumer-providers or professional staff in similar roles.There was a small reduction in crisis and emergency service use for clients receiving care involving consumer-providers (SMD -0.34 (95%CI -0.60 to -0.07). Past or present consumers who provided mental health services did so differently than professionals; they spent more time face-to-face with clients, and less time in the office, on the telephone, with clients' friends and family, or at provider agencies.Six trials involving 2215 people compared mental health services with or without the addition of consumer-providers. There were no significant differences in psychosocial outcomes (quality of life, empowerment, function, social relations), client satisfaction with service provision (SMD 0.76, 95% CI -0.59 to 2.10) and with staff (SMD 0.18, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.79), attendance rates (SMD 0.52 (95% CI -0.07 to 1.11), hospital admissions and length of stay, or attrition (risk ratio 1.29, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.31) between groups with consumer-providers as an adjunct to professional-led care and those receiving usual care from health professionals alone. One study found a small difference favouring the intervention group for both client and staff ratings of clients' needs having been met, although detection bias may have affected the latter. None of the six studies in this comparison reported client mental health outcomes.No studies in either comparison group reported data on adverse outcomes for clients, or the financial costs of service provision. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Involving consumer-providers in mental health teams results in psychosocial, mental health symptom and service use outcomes for clients that were no better or worse than those achieved by professionals employed in similar roles, particularly for case management services.There is low quality evidence that involving consumer-providers in mental health teams results in a small reduction in clients' use of crisis or emergency services. The nature of the consumer-providers' involvement differs compared to professionals, as do the resources required to support their involvement. The overall quality of the evidence is moderate to low. There is no evidence of harm associated with involving consumer-providers in mental health teams.Future randomised controlled trials of consumer-providers in mental health services should minimise bias through the use of adequate randomisation and concealment of allocation, blinding of outcome assessment where possible, the comprehensive reporting of outcome data, and the avoidance of contamination between treatment groups. Researchers should adhere to SPIRIT and CONSORT reporting standards for clinical trials.Future trials should further evaluate standardised measures of clients' mental health, adverse outcomes for clients, the potential benefits and harms to the consumer-providers themselves (including need to return to treatment), and the financial costs of the intervention. They should utilise consistent, validated measurement tools and include a clear description of the consumer-provider role (eg specific tasks, responsibilities and expected deliverables of the role) and relevant training for the role so that it can be readily implemented. The weight of evidence being strongly based in the United States, future research should be located in diverse settings including in low- and middle-income countries."
Consumers and health providers working in partnership for the promotion of person-centred health services: A coproduced qualitative evidence synthesis.	"To synthesise the views and experiences of consumers and health providers of working in partnership to promote person-centred health services. . To identify best practice principles for working in partnership at the health service level by understanding consumers' and health providers' views and experiences. Objectives . To investigate the barriers and facilitators to working in partnership and how these may promote or impede person-centred planning, delivery or evaluation of health services. For example, if consumers are given sufficient training to help them work in partnership on a hospital quality and safety committee, they may be better able to contribute the consumer perspective to quality and safety decisions. . To understand consumers' and health providers' views and experiences of working in partnership. . To analyse the ways consumers and providers work in partnership (e.g. committee formats, experience-based co-design formats)."
Consumers in mental health service leadership: A systematic review	"Contemporary mental health policies call for greater involvement of mental health service consumers in all aspects and at all levels of service planning, delivery, and evaluation. The extent to which consumers are part of the decision-making function of mental health organizations varies. This systematic review synthesizes empirical and review studies published in peer-reviewed academic journals relating to consumers in leadership roles within mental health organizations. The Cochrane Library, Medline, and PsycINFO were searched for articles specifically analysing and discussing consumers' mental health service leadership. Each article was critically appraised against the inclusion criteria, with 36 articles included in the final review. The findings of the review highlight current understandings of organizational resources and structures in consumer-led organizations, determinants of leadership involvement, and how consumer leadership interacts with traditional mental health service provision. It appears that organizations might still be negotiating the balance between consumer leadership and traditional structures and systems. The majority of included studies represent research about consumer-run organizations, with consumer leadership in mainstream mental health organizations being less represented in the literature. Advocates of consumer leadership should focus more on emphasizing how such leadership itself can be a valuable resource for organizations and how this can be better articulated. This review highlights the current gaps in understandings of consumer leadership in mental health, including a need for more research exploring the benefits of consumer leadership for other consumers of services.

Contribution of Aboriginal Community-Controlled Health Services to improving Aboriginal health: an evidence review	"Objective. Aboriginal Community-Controlled Health Services (ACCHSs) deliver comprehensive, culturally appropriate primary health care to Aboriginal people and communities. The published literature acknowledging and supporting the roles of ACCHSs in improving Aboriginal health is limited. This paper seeks to collate and analyse the published evidence supporting the contribution of ACCHSs to improving the health of Aboriginal people. Methods. A conceptual framework for exploring the contribution of ACCHSs was developed, drawing on the literature on the core functions of ACCHSs and the components of quality primary health care. This framework was used to structure the search strategy, inclusion criteria and analysis of the review. Results. ACCHSs contribute to improving the health and well being of Aboriginal peoples through several pathways, including community controlled governance, providing employment and training, strengthening the broader health system and providing accessible, comprehensive primary health care. Conclusions. ACCHSs make a range of important contributions to improving the health of Aboriginal peoples that are under-acknowledged. Consideration of the different ways ACCHSs contribute to improving Aboriginal health is of value in the design and evaluation of programs and policies that aim to improve the health of Aboriginal peoples."
Cost-effectiveness of health-related lifestyle advice delivered by peer or lay advisors: synthesis of evidence from a systematic review.	"BACKGROUND: Development of new peer or lay health-related lifestyle advisor (HRLA) roles is one response to the need to enhance public engagement in, and improve cost-effectiveness of, health improvement interventions. This article synthesises evidence on the cost-effectiveness of HRLA interventions aimed at adults in developed countries, derived from the first systematic review of the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, equity and acceptability of different types of HRLA role. METHODS: The best available evidence on the cost-effectiveness of HRLA interventions was obtained using systematic searches of 20 electronic databases and key journals, as well as searches of the grey literature and the internet. Interventions were classified according to the primary health behaviour targeted and intervention costs were estimated where necessary. Lifetime health gains were estimated (in quality-adjusted life years, where possible), based on evidence of effectiveness of HRLAs in combination with published estimates of the lifetime health gains resulting from lifestyle changes, and assumptions over relapse. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are reported. RESULTS: Evidence of the cost-effectiveness of HRLAs was identified from 24 trials included in the systematic review. The interventions were grouped into eight areas. We found little evidence of effectiveness of HRLAs for promotion of exercise/improved diets. Where HRLAs were effective cost-effectiveness varied considerably: Incremental Cost effectiveness Ratios were estimated at 6,000 for smoking cessation; 14,000 for a telephone based type 2 diabetes management; and 250,000 or greater for promotion of mammography attendance and for HIV prevention amongst drug users. We lacked sufficient evidence to estimate ICERs for breastfeeding promotion and mental health promotion, or to assess the impact of HRLAs on health inequalities. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is limited evidence suggesting that HRLAs are cost-effective in terms of changing health-related knowledge, behaviours or health outcomes. The evidence that does exist indicates that HRLAs are only cost-effective when they target behaviours likely to have a large impact on overall health-related quality of life. Further development of HRLA interventions needs to target specific population health needs where potential exists for significant improvement, and include rigorous evaluation to ensure that HRLAs provide sufficient value for money."
Creating a Culturally Safe Space When Teaching Aboriginal Content in Social Work: A Scoping Review	"Teaching Aboriginal content in social work education presents risks of retraumatisation for students. There are international calls for a trauma-informed teaching model that creates cultural safety in the classroom. This study aimed to develop a trauma-informed model for social work education by reviewing the literature on cultural safety for Aboriginal peoples. This model incorporates key aspects of ensuring Aboriginal cultural safety: de-colonise social work education; collaborative partnerships; build relationships; critical reflection; develop cultural courage; and yarning and story-telling. It provides a valuable framework for creating a more equitable teaching and learning environment that also ensures the essential academic content is covered. IMPLICATIONS Trauma underlies the historical, contemporary and cultural narratives of Aboriginal peoples. Students engaging in Aboriginal content that is traumatic can mean connecting with trauma that has occurred in their own lives. Trauma-informed teaching and learning will ensure that educators create culturally safe spaces that enable students to engage well with content. The adoption of the framework proposed in this paper may lead to the creation of a culturally safe space for teaching and learning in social work education."
Creating and facilitating change for Person-Centred Coordinated Care (P3C): The development of the Organisational Change Tool (P3C-OCT).	"BACKGROUND: Person Centred Coordinated Care (P3C) is a UK priority for patients, carers, professionals, commissioners and policy makers. Services are developing a range of approaches to deliver this care with a lack of tools to guide implementation. METHODOLOGY: A scoping review and critical examination of current policy, key literature and NHS guidelines, together with stakeholder involvement led to the identification of domains, subdomains and component activities (processes and behaviours) required to deliver P3C. These were validated through codesign with stakeholders via a series of workshops and cognitive interviews. RESULTS: Six core domains of P3C were identified as follows: (i) my goals, (ii) care planning, (iii) transitions, (iv) decision making (v), information and communication and (vi) organizational support activities. These were populated by 29 core subdomains (question items). A number of response codes (components) to each question provide examples of the processes and activities that can be actioned to achieve each core subdomain of P3C. CONCLUSION: The P3C-OCT provides a coherent approach to monitoring progress and supporting practice development towards P3C. It can be used to generate a shared understanding of the core domains of P3C at a service delivery level, and support reorganization of care for those with complex needs. The tool can reliably detect change over time, as demonstrated in a sample of 40 UK general practices. It is currently being used in four UK evaluations of new models of care and being further developed as a training tool for the delivery of P3C.

Cultural adaptation and validation of patient decision aids: a scoping review.	"In order to promote self-determination, patients have to be actively involved with their care providers in health-care decision making, especially when such decisions involve personal preferences. Decision aids (DAs) are tools that can contribute to patient-centered decision-making processes. To benefit from previous fieldwork and avoid duplicating developmental efforts and producing many similar DAs, the adaptation of existing DAs to new cultural contexts is a resource-saving option. However, there are no guidelines on how to culturally adapt and validate DAs. This study aimed to identify and document existing procedures for the cultural adaptation and validation of patient DAs. A scoping review examined studies conducting cultural adaptation and/or validation of patient DAs. The following databases were searched in February 2016: CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline (Ovid), PASCAL, PsychINFO, and PubMed. From the 13 studies selected, 11 main procedures were identified: appraisal of the original DA, assessment of the new cultural context, translation, linguistic adaptation, cultural adaptation, usability testing, exploration of DA acceptability, test-retest reliability, content validity, construct validity, and criterion validity. A conceptual synthesis of these studies suggests there are four phases in the adaptation/validation process of DAs aimed at: 1) exploring the original DA and the new cultural context, 2) adapting the original DA to the new cultural context, 3) lab testing the preliminary version of the adapted DA, and 4) field testing the adapted DA in a real use context. By facilitating the adaptation and broader implementation of DAs, patients may ultimately be empowered in decision-making processes."
Cultural safety strategies for rural Indigenous palliative care: a scoping review.	"BACKGROUND: There is little scholarship on culturally safe approaches to palliative care, especially for rural Indigenous clients. Thus, it is important to articulate how cultural safety can be enacted to support rural Indigenous Peoples and communities at end of life. We sought to identify strategies described in existing literature that have potential to deepen our understanding of culturally safe approaches to palliative care within rural and small-town settings in Canada. METHODS: We searched for peer-reviewed and grey literature about Indigenous palliative care in rural and small-town settings in Canada, United States, New Zealand, and Australia. Medline, CINAHL, and Embase were searched. We thematically analyzed 22 resulting articles to address our interest in culturally safe approaches to palliative care in rural/small-town and on-reserve contexts. RESULTS: The following themes were extracted from the literature: symbolic or small gestures; anticipating barriers to care; defer to client, family and community; shared decision-Making; active patient and family involvement; respectful, clear, and culturally appropriate communication; community ownership of services; empower cultural identity, knowledge, and traditions; and, policy. DISCUSSION: Culturally competent practices can improve Indigenous palliative care services; however, they do not result in decolonized care. Strategies include: symbolic or small gestures; anticipating barriers to access; deferring to the client, family, and community members; and, collective decision making and family involvement. Culturally safe approaches contribute to institutional or organizational change and decolonized care. Strategies include: involvement of patient and family in service planning; reflection about individual and systemic racism; community ownership of services and; recognizing distinct Worldviews that shape care. CONCLUSIONS: Culturally safe strategies invite decolonization of care through awareness of colonialism, racism, and discrimination. They invite commitment to building partnerships, power sharing, and decision-making in the delivery of care. Culturally competent activities may catalyze the adoption of a cultural safety framework; however, mislabeling of cultural competency as cultural safety may contribute to organizational inaction and a watering down of the spirit of cultural safety."
Culturally appropriate health education for people in ethnic minority groups with type 2 diabetes mellitus.	"Background Ethnic minority groups in upper-middle-income and high-income countries tend to be socioeconomically disadvantaged and to have a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes than is seen in the majority population. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of culturally appropriate health education for people in ethnic minority groups with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Search methods A systematic literature search was performed of the following databases: The Cochrane LibraryMEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and Google Scholar, as well as reference lists of identified articles. The date of the last search was July 2013 for The Cochrane Library and September 2013 for all other databases. We contacted authors in the field and handsearched commonly encountered journals as well. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of culturally appropriate health education for people over 16 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus from named ethnic minority groups residing in upper-middle-income or high-income countries. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When disagreements arose regarding selection of papers for inclusion, two additional review authors were consulted for discussion. We contacted study authors to ask for additional information when data appeared to be missing or needed clarification. Main results A total of 33 trials (including 11 from the original 2008 review) involving 7453 participants were included in this review, with 28 trials providing suitable data for entry into meta-analysis. Although the interventions provided in these studies were very different from one study to another (participant numbers, duration of intervention, group versus individual intervention, setting), most of the studies were based on recognisable theoretical models, and we tried to be inclusive in considering the wide variety of available culturally appropriate health education. Authors' conclusions Culturally appropriate health education has short- to medium-term effects on glycaemic control and on knowledge of diabetes and healthy lifestyles. With this update (six years after the first publication of this review), a greater number of RCTs were reported to be of sufficient quality for inclusion in the review. None of these studies were long-term trials, and so clinically important long-term outcomes could not be studied. No studies included an economic analysis. The heterogeneity of the studies made subgroup comparisons difficult to interpret with confidence. Long-term, standardised, multi-centre RCTs are needed to compare different types and intensities of culturally appropriate health education within defined ethnic minority groups, as the medium-term effects could lead to clinically important health outcomes, if sustained."
Current trends in patient and public involvement in cancer research: A systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Patient and public involvement (PPI) in health research is on the rise worldwide. Within cancer research, PPI ensures that the rapid development of medical and technological opportunities for diagnostics, treatment and care corresponds with the needs and priorities of people affected by cancer. An overview of the experiences, outcomes and quality of recent PPI in cancer research would provide valuable information for future research. OBJECTIVE: To describe the current state of PPI in cancer research focusing on the research stages, applied methods, stated purposes and outcomes, and challenges and recommendations. METHODS: A search was conducted on PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO for literature published from December 2006 to April 2017. Original research studies describing the involvement of cancer patients, stakeholders and carers as active partners at any stage of the research process were included. RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were included, the majority reporting PPI at the early stages of research, that is, during the definition and prioritization of research topics and the development of recruitment strategies. Few studies reported PPI at later stages and across the research process. Challenges and recommendations were only briefly described, and critical reflection on the PPI process was lacking. CONCLUSION: PPI needs to be integrated more broadly in the cancer research process. The quality of reporting PPI should be strengthened through greater critical reflections including both positive and negative experiences of the PPI process. This will contribute to the further development of PPI and its potential in cancer research. Copyright ¬© 2018 The Authors Health Expectations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
Dealing with major life events and transitions: A systematic literature review on and occupational analysis of spirituality	"This systematic literature review analyzed the construct of spirituality as perceived by people who have experienced or are experiencing a major life event or transition. The researchers investigated studies that used narrative analysis or a phenomenological methodology related to the topic. Thematic analysis resulted in three major themes: (1) avenues to and through spirituality, (2) the experience of spirituality, and (3) the meaning of spirituality. The results provide insights into the intersection of spirituality, meaning, and occupational engagement as understood by people experiencing a major life event or transition and suggest further research that addresses spirituality in occupational therapy and interdisciplinary intervention.

Delivering dignified care: A realist synthesis of evidence that promotes effective listening to and learning from older people's feedback in acute care settings	"Aims and objectives: To explore effective mechanisms for listening to and learning from feedback from older people in the context of acute care. Background: Maintaining the dignity of older people in acute care has become an issue of international concern. In the United Kingdom, recommendations for care improvement have led to the formation of an implementation group, the 'Listening and Learning Hospitals Pilot Project.' This literature review forms phase 1 of the project. Design: Realist synthesis was used to explore and synthesise wide-ranging evidence. Methods: Using 12 databases, literature was scoped to propose four principles that underpin the context, mechanism and outcomes (CMO) of effective relation-based interventions with older people and their care partners in the acute care setting. A search was carried out in order to synthesise data to refute or support each principle. A total of 137 studies and 11 sources of grey literature were appraised and included. A final synthesis of evidence across all principles identified key mechanisms for effective relation-based interventions. Results: Eight essential mechanisms support effective care interventions. Conclusions: This review adds depth and breadth to current nursing knowledge in this field through the process of realist synthesis. Acute care organisations need to make a commitment to supporting relational care at organisation and unit levels. Additionally, they need to value and support the well-being of the nurses delivering it so that interventions to improve care for older people can succeed. Relevance to clinical practice: Essential mechanisms synthesised from the review, together with other suggested interventions for improving dignified care of older people in acute care by listening to them and learning from their feedback, may contribute towards practice development in acute care.

Dementia-friendly community initiatives: An integrative review	"Aim: To synthesise international research conducted on dementia-friendly community initiatives. Background: The number of people living with dementia is increasing as a result of population ageing. Impairments related to neurological changes, together with environmental challenges, result in disability for people who have dementia. Led by the World Health Organization and Alzheimer's Disease International, initiatives have been undertaken internationally to promote social inclusion for people who have dementia. Communities where people with dementia are able to remain socially included are known as dementia-friendly communities. Design: An integrative review of the literature. Methods: Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Science and CINAHL Plus via Ebsco databases were searched for relevant articles. The PRISMA framework guided the article search and screening; reporting is in accordance with the PRISMA guideline. Eight eligible studies were identified. The methodological quality of the eligible studies was evaluated using the MMAT checklist. The matrix method was used to extract, abstract and analyse the data. Results: Of the eight studies reviewed, five were from the UK and one each from Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Four major concepts were identified in the literature, and these are characteristics of dementia-friendly communities, facilitators and barriers to community engagement for people with dementia, strategies for developing dementia-friendly communities and challenges encountered when developing dementia-friendly communities. Conclusion: People with dementia are at the centre of dementia-friendly initiatives, and these foster social inclusion. Collaborations and partnerships enhance development of dementia-friendly communities; however, lack of resources and difficulty ensuring representation of marginalised groups provide challenges. Relevance to clinical practice: An understanding of the impact of marginalisation and inequality on community participation for people with dementia is important for practitioners, enabling them to support those people. Senior nurses with this understanding can ensure services are able to meet the needs of a growing population with dementia."
Design Features of Explicit Values Clarification Methods: A Systematic Review	"BACKGROUND: Values clarification is a recommended element of patient decision aids. Many different values clarification methods exist, but there is little evidence synthesis available to guide design decisions. PURPOSE: To describe practices in the field of explicit values clarification methods according to a taxonomy of design features. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, all EBM Reviews, CINAHL, EMBASE, Google Scholar, manual search of reference lists, and expert contacts. STUDY SELECTION: Articles were included if they described 1 or more explicit values clarification methods. DATA EXTRACTION: We extracted data about decisions addressed; use of theories, frameworks, and guidelines; and 12 design features. DATA SYNTHESIS: We identified 110 articles describing 98 explicit values clarification methods. Most of these addressed decisions in cancer or reproductive health, and half addressed a decision between just 2 options. Most used neither theory nor guidelines to structure their design. ""Pros and cons"" was the most common type of values clarification method. Most methods did not allow users to add their own concerns. Few methods explicitly presented tradeoffs inherent in the decision, supported an iterative process of values exploration, or showed how different options aligned with users' values. LIMITATIONS: Study selection criteria and choice of elements for the taxonomy may have excluded values clarification methods or design features. CONCLUSIONS: Explicit values clarification methods have diverse designs but can be systematically cataloged within the structure of a taxonomy. Developers of values clarification methods should carefully consider each of the design features in this taxonomy and publish adequate descriptions of their designs. More research is needed to study the effects of different design features. Copyright ¬© The Author(s) 2016."
"Designing, Implementing, and Evaluating Mobile Health Technologies for Managing Chronic Conditions in Older Adults: A Scoping Review"	"BACKGROUND: The current landscape of a rapidly aging population accompanied by multiple chronic conditions presents numerous challenges to optimally support the complex needs of this group. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies have shown promise in supporting older persons to manage chronic conditions; however, there remains a dearth of evidence-informed guidance to develop such innovations. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to conduct a scoping review of current practices and recommendations for designing, implementing, and evaluating mHealth technologies to support the management of chronic conditions in community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: A 5-stage scoping review methodology was used to map the relevant literature published between January 2005 and March 2015 as follows: (1) identified the research question, (2) identified relevant studies, (3) selected relevant studies for review, (4) charted data from selected literature, and (5) summarized and reported results. Electronic searches were conducted in 5 databases. In addition, hand searches of reference lists and a key journal were completed. Inclusion criteria were research and nonresearch papers focused on mHealth technologies designed for use by community-living older adults with at least one chronic condition, or health care providers or informal caregivers providing care in the home and community setting. Two reviewers independently identified articles for review and extracted data. RESULTS: We identified 42 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, described innovations focused on older adults with specific chronic conditions (n=17), chronic conditions in general (n=6), or older adults in general or those receiving homecare services (n=18). Most of the mHealth solutions described were designed for use by both patients and health care providers or health care providers only. Thematic categories identified included the following: (1) practices and considerations when designing mHealth technologies; (2) factors that support/hinder feasibility, acceptability, and usability of mHealth technologies; and (3) approaches or methods for evaluating mHealth technologies. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited yet increasing use of mHealth technologies in home health care for older adults. A user-centered, collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to enhance feasibility, acceptability, and usability of mHealth innovations is imperative. Creating teams with the required pools of expertise and insight regarding needs is critical. The cyclical, iterative process of developing mHealth innovations needs to be viewed as a whole with supportive theoretical frameworks. Many barriers to implementation and sustainability have limited the number of successful, evidence-based mHealth solutions beyond the pilot or feasibility stage. The science of implementation of mHealth technologies in home-based care for older adults and self-management of chronic conditions are important areas for further research. Additionally, changing needs as cohorts and technologies advance are important considerations. Lessons learned from the data and important implications for practice, policy, and research are discussed to inform the future development of innovations."
Determinants of health knowledge and health perceptions from the perspective of health-related education of patients with spinal cord injury: a systematic review	"Appropriate health knowledge (HK) and health perceptions (HP) of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) are linked to health-related behaviors, compliance, the involvement of caregivers and efficacy of prophylaxis, and management of secondary conditions. The significance of factors determining the efficacy of educational interventions in patients with SCI is underestimated. This systematic literature review aims at identification of determinants of HK and HP among patients with SCI. We identified 16 papers with quantitative HK and HP measurements conclusive in the identification of HK and HP determinants in individuals with SCI. Better HK and HP correlated with health condition-related variables (traumatic SCI, history of secondary conditions, except depression), body functions and structures (tetraplegia, incomplete deficit), activities (independence in daily living activities, ability of locomotion on a wheelchair, inability to walk), social and vocational participation, environmental factors (access to a computer with Internet connection, living in a big city, being married, healthcare recently received), and personal factors (younger age among adults, living with SCI for a longer time, younger age at SCI onset, higher educational level, internal locus of control). Limitations encountered included high nonresponse rates among the patients enrolled, and use of heterogeneous and nonvalidated tools. The results of these studies do not cover the entire scope of possible interactions and exclusively apply univariate correlations. The paucity and methodological limitations of studies conclusive in the identification of HK and HP determinants in SCI patients and the development of new approaches to information and education warrant more high-quality research on the basis of multivariate analyses."

Developing a core outcome set for fistulising perianal Crohn's disease.	"Objective Lack of standardised outcomes hampers effective analysis and comparison of data when comparing treatments in fistulising perianal Crohn's disease (pCD). Development of a standardised set of outcomes would resolve these issues. This study provides the definitive core outcome set (COS) for fistulising pCD. Design Candidate outcomes were generated through a systematic review and patient interviews. Consensus was established via a three-round Delphi process using a 9-point Likert scale based on how important they felt it was in determining treatment success culminating in a final consensus meeting. Stakeholders were recruited nationally and grouped into three panels (surgeons and radiologists, gastroenterologists and IBD specialist nurses, and patients). Participants received feedback from their panel (in the second round) and all participants (in the third round) to allow refinement of their scores. Results A total of 295 outcomes were identified from systematic reviews and interviews that were categorised into 92 domains. 187 stakeholders (response rate 78.5%) prioritised 49 outcomes through a three-round Delphi study. The final consensus meeting of 41 experts and patients generated agreement on an eight domain COS. The COS comprised three patient-reported outcome domains (quality of life, incontinence and a combined score of patient priorities) and five clinician-reported outcome domains (perianal disease activity, development of new perianal abscess/sepsis, new/recurrent fistula, unplanned surgery and faecal diversion). Conclusion A fistulising pCD COS has been produced by all key stakeholders. Application of the COS will reduce heterogeneity in outcome reporting, thereby facilitating more meaningful comparisons between treatments, data synthesis and ultimately benefit patient care."
Developing a new clinical governance framework for chronic diseases in primary care: an umbrella review.	"OBJECTIVES: Our goal is to conceptualise a clinical governance framework for the effective management of chronic diseases in the primary care setting, which will facilitate a reorganisation of healthcare services that systematically improves their performance. SETTING: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: Chronic Care Model by Wagner et aland Clinical Governance statement by Scally et alwere taken for reference. Each was reviewed, including their various components. We then conceptualised a new framework, merging the relevant aspects of both. INTERVENTIONS: We conducted an umbrella review of all systematic reviews published by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group to identify organisational interventions in primary care with demonstrated evidence of efficacy. RESULTS: All primary healthcare systems should be patient-centred. Interventions for patients and their families should focus on their values; on clinical, professional and institutional integration and finally on accountability to patients, peers and society at large. These interventions should be shaped by an approach to their clinical management that achieves the best clinical governance, which includes quality assurance, risk management, technology assessment, management of patient satisfaction and patient empowerment and engagement. This approach demands the implementation of a system of organisational, functional and professional management based on a population health needs assessment, resource management, evidence-based and patient-oriented research, professional education, team building and information and communication technologies that support the delivery system. All primary care should be embedded in and founded on an active partnership with the society it serves. CONCLUSIONS: A framework for clinical governance will promote an integrated effort to bring together all related activities, melding environmental, administrative, support and clinical elements to ensure a coordinated and integrated approach that sustains the provision of better care for chronic conditions in primary care setting.

Development and Use of Health-Related Technologies in Indigenous Communities: Critical Review	"Background: Older Indigenous adults encounter multiple challenges as their age intersects with health inequities. Research suggests that a majority of older Indigenous adults prefer to age in place, and they will need culturally safe assistive technologies to do so.Objective: The aim of this critical review was to examine literature concerning use, adaptation, and development of assistive technologies for health purposes by Indigenous peoples.Methods: Working within Indigenous research methodologies and from a decolonizing approach, searches of peer-reviewed academic and gray literature dated to February 2016 were conducted using keywords related to assistive technology and Indigenous peoples. Sources were reviewed and coded thematically.Results: Of the 34 sources captured, only 2 concerned technology specifically for older Indigenous adults. Studies detailing technology with Indigenous populations of all ages originated primarily from Canada (n=12), Australia (n=10), and the United States (n=9) and were coded to four themes: meaningful user involvement and community-based processes in development, the digital divide, Indigenous innovation in technology, and health technology needs as holistic and interdependent.Conclusions: A key finding is the necessity of meaningful user involvement in technology development, especially in communities struggling with the digital divide. In spite of, or perhaps because of this divide, Indigenous communities are enthusiastically adapting mobile technologies to suit their needs in creative, culturally specific ways. This enthusiasm and creativity, coupled with the extensive experience many Indigenous communities have with telehealth technologies, presents opportunity for meaningful, culturally safe development processes."
Development of a Conceptual Framework for Understanding Shared Decision making Among African-American LGBT Patients and their Clinicians	"BACKGROUND: Enhancing patient-centered care and shared decision making (SDM) has become a national priority as a means of engaging patients in their care, improving treatment adherence, and enhancing health outcomes. Relatively little is known about the healthcare experiences or shared decision making among racial/ethnic minorities who also identify as being LGBT. The purpose of this paper is to understand how race, sexual orientation and gender identity can simultaneously influence SDM among African-American LGBT persons, and to propose a model of SDM between such patients and their healthcare providers. METHODS: We reviewed key constructs necessary for understanding SDM among African-American LGBT persons, which guided our systematic literature review. Eligible studies for the review included English-language studies of adults (>= 19 y/o) in North America, with a focus on LGBT persons who were African-American/black (i.e., > 50 % of the study population) or included sub-analyses by sexual orientation/gender identity and race. We searched PubMed, CINAHL, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases using MESH terms and keywords related to shared decision making, communication quality (e.g., trust, bias), African-Americans, and LGBT persons. Additional references were identified by manual reviews of peer-reviewed journals' tables of contents and key papers' references. RESULTS: We identified 2298 abstracts, three of which met the inclusion criteria. Of the included studies, one was cross-sectional and two were qualitative; one study involved transgender women (91 % minorities, 65 % of whom were African-Americans), and two involved African-American men who have sex with men (MSM). All of the studies focused on HIV infection. Sexual orientation and gender identity were patient-reported factors that negatively impacted patient/provider relationships and SDM. Engaging in SDM helped some patients overcome normative beliefs about clinical encounters. In this paper, we present a conceptual model for understanding SDM in African-American LGBT persons, wherein multiple systems of social stratification (e.g., race, gender, sexual orientation) influence patient and provider perceptions, behaviors, and shared decision making. DISCUSSION: Few studies exist that explore SDM among African-American LGBT persons, and no interventions were identified in our systematic review. Thus, we are unable to draw conclusions about the effect size of SDM among this population on health outcomes. Qualitative work suggests that race, sexual orientation and gender work collectively to enhance perceptions of discrimination and decrease SDM among African-American LGBT persons. More research is needed to obtain a comprehensive understanding of shared decision making and subsequent health outcomes among African-Americans along the entire spectrum of gender and sexual orientation."
"Development of a core outcome set for disease modification trials in mild to moderate dementia: a systematic review, patient and public consultation and consensus recommendations."	"BACKGROUND: There is currently no disease-modifying treatment available to halt or delay the progression of the disease pathology in dementia. An agreed core set of the best-available and most appropriate outcomes for disease modification would facilitate the design of trials and ensure consistency across disease modification trials, as well as making results comparable and meta-analysable in future trials. OBJECTIVES: To agree a set of core outcomes for disease modification trials for mild to moderate dementia with the UK dementia research community and patient and public involvement (PPI). DATA SOURCES: We included disease modification trials with quantitative outcomes of efficacy from (1) references from related systematic reviews in workstream 1; (2) searches of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group study register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature and PsycINFO on 11 December 2015, and clinical trial registries International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) and clinicaltrials.gov] on 22 and 29 January 2016; and (3) hand-searches of reference lists of relevant systematic reviews from database searches. REVIEW METHODS: The project consisted of four workstreams. (1) We obtained related core outcome sets and work from co-applicants. (2) We systematically reviewed published and ongoing disease modification trials to identify the outcomes used in different domains. We extracted outcomes used in each trial, recording how many used each outcome and with how many participants. We divided outcomes into the domains measured and searched for validation data. (3) We consulted with PPI participants about recommended outcomes. (4) We presented all the synthesised information at a conference attended by the wider body of National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) dementia researchers to reach consensus on a core set of outcomes. RESULTS: We included 149 papers from the 22,918 papers screened, referring to 125 individual trials. Eighty-one outcomes were used across trials, including 72 scales 31 cognitive, 12 activities of daily living (ADLs), 10 global, 16 neuropsychiatric and three quality of life] and nine biological techniques. We consulted with 18 people for PPI. The conference decided that only cognition and biological markers are core measures of disease modification. Cognition should be measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and brain changes through structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of participants. All other domains are important but not core. We recommend using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory for neuropsychiatric symptoms: the Disability Assessment for Dementia for ADLs, the Dementia Quality of Life Measure for quality of life and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale to measure dementia globally. LIMITATIONS: Most of the trials included participants with Alzheimer's disease, so recommendations may not apply to other types of dementia. We did not conduct economic analyses. The PPI consultation was limited to members of the Alzheimer's Society Research Network. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive outcomes and biological markers form the core outcome set for future disease modification trials, measured by the MMSE or ADAS-Cog, and structural MRI in a subset of participants. FUTURE WORK: We envisage that the core set may be superseded in the future, particularly for other types of dementia. There is a need to develop an algorithm to compare scores on the MMSE and ADAS-Cog. STUDY REGISTRATION: The project was registered with Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials www.comet-initiative.org/studies/details/819?result=true (accessed 7 April 2016)]. The systematic review protocol is registered as PROSPERO CRD42015027346. FUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme."
Development of patient-centred standards of care for osteoarthritis in Europe: the eumusc.net-project	"OBJECTIVE: The eumusc.net project is an initiative founded by the European Community and the European League Against Rheumatism. One aim of the project was to facilitate equal standards for musculoskeletal health across Europe. The aim of this work-package was to develop patient-centred and consensus based standards of care (SOC) for osteoarthritis (OA), which should be available in a professional and a patient version. METHODS: A systematic review concerning guidelines dealing with OA was conducted. Furthermore, experts in musculoskeletal diseases were contacted to ensure that 'grey' literature was not excluded. Documents that fulfilled predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria were included and all interventions for OA were extracted and categorised. Based on this list of interventions, a three round Delphi exercise with an international and multidisciplinary expert panel, including patient research partners, was performed to achieve expert consensus. RESULTS: Six documents were included and used for further analysis. Out of them, 46 interventions have been extracted and 10 consensus based SOC were formulated. In addition, a patient version, written in a lay-understandable wording and in the format of checklist questions was developed. An example is SOC 5: ""People with OA should achieve optimal pain control using pharmacological and non-pharmacological means."" The matching patient-centred checklist question reads: ""Do I know how to control pain associated with OA?"" CONCLUSIONS: The SOC for OA will be available in the 23 languages of the European Union to enhance unified information to patients and professionals and to further harmonise the treatment/care of OA within Europe.

Diabetes Conversation MapTM and health outcomes: A systematic literature review	"OBJECTIVES: To identify, describe, and assess the evidence regarding the effects that the Diabetes Conversation MapTM program, an educational tool that engages patients with diabetes in group discussions about diabetes-related topics, has over a range of patient outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Five databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane Collaboration, were utilized to identify studies that evaluated the Conversation MapTM program. Additionally, the reference lists of the identified studies were manually reviewed. REVIEW METHODS: Studies that evaluated the Conversation MapTM program since 2005 were included. Non-English languages, non-journal papers, and studies that only included a description of the program were excluded. A quality assessment of relevant studies was performed. Outcomes were grouped into: objective (e.g., HbA1c levels), subjective (e.g., self-efficacy), and health behaviors (e.g., medication adherence). RESULTS: Of the 85 studies originally identified, 24 studies were included in the final sample. The overall methodological quality of the studies was intermediate (score: 17 of 28). Almost all studies examined objective health measures, with most indicating non-significant differences between the Conversation MapTM intervention and the control groups. Conflicting results were found regarding the influence the program had on HbA1c. The majority of studies reported no significant change in blood pressure and mixed results were found regarding other health indicators. Twelve studies examined subjective measures and 11 assessed the effects on health behaviors, mostly reporting non-significant or positive findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our review shows that although the Diabetes Conversation MapTM program holds the potential to improve patient behaviors and outcomes, current research on the program provides limited support as to their relationship with positive patient outcomes. Larger, more sophisticated studies are needed in order to determine the potential influence Conversation MapTM can have on long-term health outcomes. Copyright ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Diabetes Prevention in U.S. Hispanic Adults: A Systematic Review of Culturally Tailored Interventions	"CONTEXT: Type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and metabolic syndrome are highly prevalent in Hispanic individuals in the U.S. Cultural adaptations of traditional lifestyle interventions have been recommended to better reach this high-risk population. This systematic review examined the effectiveness of diabetes prevention programs for Hispanics in lowering risk for Type 2 diabetes, as evidenced by a reduction in weight or improvement in glucose regulation. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and PsycINFO were searched from database inception to June 2016 for studies that evaluated diabetes prevention trials targeting U.S. Hispanic populations. Twelve publications met criteria for inclusion. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Interventions varied substantially in length, rigor, and tailoring strategies. Five of 12 studies were RCTs. Eight studies included entirely or largely (>70%) female samples. All studies were delivered in Spanish and took place in community settings. Nine studies reported significant reductions in weight, and two in glucose regulation, post-intervention or when compared with controls. Effect sizes were small to moderate, study quality was moderate, and attrition was high in most trials. Interventions with the largest effect sizes included one or more of the following adaptations: literacy modification, Hispanic foods/recipes, cultural diabetes beliefs, family/friend participation, structured community input, and innovative experiential learning. CONCLUSIONS: Culturally tailored lifestyle interventions for diabetes prevention appear to be modestly effective in reducing risk for diabetes in Hispanics in the U.S. More studies are needed that utilize randomized controlled designs, recruit Hispanic men, report intervention content and tailoring strategies systematically, and publish participant evaluation and feedback.

Digital Clinical Communication for Families and Caregivers of Children or Young People With Short- or Long-Term Conditions: Rapid Review	"BACKGROUND: The communication relationship between parents of children or young people with health conditions and health professionals is an important part of treatment, but it is unclear how far the use of digital clinical communication tools may affect this relationship. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to describe, assess the feasibility of, and explore the impact of digital clinical communication between families or caregivers and health professionals. METHODS: We searched the literature using 5 electronic databases. We considered all types of study design published in the English language from January 2009 to August 2015. The population of interest included families and caregivers of children and young people aged less than 26 years with any type of health condition. The intervention was any technology permitting 2-way communication. RESULTS: We included 31 articles. The main designs were randomized controlled trials (RCTs; n=10), cross-sectional studies (n=9), pre- and postintervention uncontrolled (pre/post) studies (n=7), and qualitative interview studies (n=2); 6 had mixed-methods designs. In the majority of cases, we considered the quality rating to be fair. Many different types of health condition were represented. A breadth of digital communication tools were included: videoconferencing or videoconsultation (n=14), and Web messaging or emails (n=12). Health care professionals were mainly therapists or cognitive behavioral therapists (n=10), physicians (n=8), and nurses (n=6). Studies were very heterogeneous in terms of outcomes. Interventions were mainly evaluated using satisfaction or acceptance, or outcomes relating to feasibility. Clinical outcomes were rarely used. The RCTs showed that digital clinical communication had no impact in comparison with standard care. Uncontrolled pre/post studies showed good rates of satisfaction or acceptance. Some economic studies suggested that digital clinical communication may save costs. CONCLUSIONS: This rapid review showed an emerging body of literature on the use of digital clinical communication to improve families' and caregivers' involvement in the health management of children or young people. Further research with appropriate study designs and longer-term outcome measures should be encouraged.

Dimensions of lay health worker programmes: results of a scoping study and production of a descriptive framework	"BACKGROUND: Approaches that engage and support lay health workers in the delivery of health improvement activities have been widely applied across different health issues and populations. The lack of a common terminology, inconsistency in the use of role descriptors and poor indexing of lay health worker roles are all barriers to the development of a shared evidence base for lay health worker interventions. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the paper is to report results from a scoping study of approaches to involve lay people in public health roles and to present a framework for categorisation of the different dimensions of lay health worker programmes. METHODS: Our scoping study comprised a systematic scoping review to map the literature on lay health worker interventions and to identify role dimensions and common models. The review, which was limited to interventions relevant to UK public health priorities, covered a total of 224 publications. The scoping study also drew on experiential evidence from UK practice. RESULTS: Research-based and practice-based evidence confirmed the variety of role descriptors in use and the complexity of role dimensions. Five common models that define the primary role of the lay health worker were identified from the literature. A framework was later developed that grouped features of lay health worker programmes into four dimensions: intervention, role, professional support/service and the community. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: More account needs to be taken of the variations that occur between lay health worker programmes. This framework, with the mapping of key categories of difference, may enable better description of lay health worker programmes, which will in turn assist in building a shared evidence base. More research is needed to examine the transferability of the framework within different contexts."
Disclosing conflicts of interest in patient decision aids	"BACKGROUND: In 2005, the International Patient Decisions Aid Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration developed quality criteria for patient decisions aids; one of the quality dimensions dealt with disclosure of conflicts of interest (COIs). The purposes of this paper are to review newer evidence on dealing with COI in the development of patient decision aids and to readdress the theoretical justification and definition for this quality dimension. METHODS: The committee conducted a primary systematic literature review to seek published research addressing the question, ""What is the evidence that disclosure of COIs in patient decision aids reduces biased decision making?"" A secondary literature review included a systematic search for recent meta-analyses addressing COIs in other spheres of health care, including research and publication, medical education, and clinical care. RESULTS: No direct evidence was found addressing this quality dimension in the primary literature review. The secondary review yielded a comprehensive Institute of Medicine report, as well as four relevant meta-analyses addressing disclosure of COIs in health care. They revealed a broad consensus that disclosure of COIs is desirable in such areas as research publication, guideline development, medical education, and clinical care. CONCLUSIONS: The committee recommends the criteria that are currently used to operationally define the quality dimension ""disclosing conflicts of interest"" be changed as follows (changes in italics): Does the patient decision aid: * report prominently and in plain language the source of funding to develop or exclusively distribute the patient decision aid? * report prominently and in plain language whether funders, authors, or their affiliations, stand to gain or lose by choices patients make after using the patient decision aid? Furthermore, based on a consensus that simple disclosure is insufficient to protect users from potentially biased information, the committee recommends that the IPDAS Collaboration consider adding the following criterion when the IPDAS consensus process is next conducted: ""Does the patient decision aid: * report that no funding to develop or exclusively distribute the patient decision aid has been received from commercial, for-profit entities that sell tests or treatments included as options in the patient decision aid?"""
Dissemination of drinking water contamination data to consumers: a systematic review of impact on consumer behaviors	"BACKGROUND: Drinking water contaminated by chemicals or pathogens is a major public health threat in the developing world. Responses to this threat often require water consumers (households or communities) to improve their own management or treatment of water. One approach hypothesized to increase such positive behaviors is increasing knowledge of the risks of unsafe water through the dissemination of water contamination data. This paper reviews the evidence for this approach in changing behavior and subsequent health outcomes. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A systematic review was conducted for studies where results of tests for contaminants in drinking water were disseminated to populations whose water supply posed a known health risk. Studies of any design were included where data were available from a contemporaneous comparison or control group. Using multiple sources >14,000 documents were located. Six studies met inclusion criteria (four of arsenic contamination and two of microbiological contamination). Meta-analysis was not possible in most cases due to heterogeneity of outcomes and study designs. Outcomes included water quality, change of water source, treatment of water, knowledge of contamination, and urinary arsenic. Source switching was most frequently reported: of 5 reporting studies 4 report significantly higher rates of switching (26-72%) among those who received a positive test result and a pooled risk difference was calculate for 2 studies (RD = 0.43 CI0.4.0-0.46] 6-12 months post intervention) suggesting 43% more of those with unsafe wells switched source compared to those with safe wells. Strength of evidence is low since the comparison is between non-equivalent groups. Two studies concerning fecal contamination reported non-significant increases in point-of-use water treatment. CONCLUSION: Despite the publication of some large cohort studies and some encouraging results the evidence base to support dissemination of contamination data to improve water management is currently equivocal. Rigorous studies on this topic are needed, ideally using common outcome measures."
Do cancer helplines deliver benefits to people affected by cancer? A systematic review	"OBJECTIVES: To determine the: (1) proportion of studies that describe characteristics of helpline service delivery, compared to the proportion that report trials testing efficacy or effectiveness of helplines in changing user outcomes; (2) proportion of efficacy or effectiveness studies that meet EPOC criteria for methodological rigor; and (3) potential benefits of cancer helplines for people affected by cancer based on findings from rigorous efficacy or effectiveness trials. METHODS: Electronic databases (Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE and CINAHL) were searched to identify English-language studies describing original research published from 1991 to 2011. RESULTS: Twenty-eight publications met the review inclusion criteria. From these studies, data on: the characteristics of cancer helpline users; call content; and user satisfaction, were extracted. The potential for helplines to improve the psychosocial outcomes of callers was examined for the three intervention trials. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of robust evidence regarding the level and types of benefits that cancer helplines may deliver to callers affected by cancer. Given increased emphasis on delivering best-practise supportive care, building the evidence base in this field may assist cancer helplines to increase their service uptake, reach, and benefit to callers. PRACTISE IMPLICATIONS: There is a need for more rigorous intervention-focussed studies in this field across a broader range of cancer populations. Future studies should focus on relevant patient-centred outcomes, such as improved knowledge and greater involvement in decision-making, while incorporating process measures to account for intervention fidelity and clinical performance.

Do interventions designed to support shared decision- making reduce health inequalities? A systematic review and meta-analysis.	"Background: Increasing patient engagement in healthcare has become a health policy priority. However, there has been concern that promoting supported shared decision-making could increase health inequalities. Objective: To evaluate the impact of SDM interventions on disadvantaged groups and health inequalities. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies. Data Sources: CINAHL, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, HMIC, MEDLINE, the NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Open SIGLE, PsycINFO and Web of Knowledge were searched from inception until June 2012. Study Eligibility Criteria: We included all studies, without language restriction, that met the following two criteria: (1) assess the effect of shared decision-making interventions on disadvantaged groups and/or health inequalities, (2) include at least 50% of people from disadvantaged groups, except if a separate analysis was conducted for this group. Results: We included 19 studies and pooled 10 in a meta-analysis. The meta-analyses showed a moderate positive effect of shared decision-making interventions on disadvantaged patients. The narrative synthesis suggested that, overall, SDM interventions increased knowledge, informed choice, participation in decision-making, decision self-efficacy, preference for collaborative decision making and reduced decisional conflict among disadvantaged patients. Further, 7 out of 19 studies compared the intervention's effect between high and low literacy groups. Overall, SDM interventions seemed to benefit disadvantaged groups (e.g. lower literacy) more than those with higher literacy, education and socioeconomic status. Interventions that were tailored to disadvantaged groups' needs appeared most effective. Conclusion: Results indicate that shared decision-making interventions significantly improve outcomes for disadvantaged patients. According to the narrative synthesis, SDM interventions may be more beneficial to disadvantaged groups than higher literacy/socioeconomic status patients. However, given the small sample sizes and variety in the intervention types, study design and quality, those findings should be interpreted with caution. ¬© 2014 Durand et al."
Do Interventions that Promote Awareness of Rights Increase Use of Maternity Care Services? A Systematic Review	"Twenty years after the rights of women to go through pregnancy and childbirth safely were recognized by governments, we assessed the effects of interventions that promote awareness of these rights to increase use of maternity care services. Using inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in a peer-reviewed protocol, we searched published and grey literature from one database of studies on maternal health, two search engines, an internet search and contact with experts. From the 707 unique documents found, 219 made reference to rights, with 22 detailing interventions promoting awareness of rights for maternal and newborn health. Only four of these evaluated effects on health outcomes. While all four interventions promoted awareness of rights, they did so in different ways. Interventions included highly-scripted dissemination meetings with educational materials and other visual aids, participatory approaches that combined raising awareness of rights with improving accountability of services, and broader multi-stakeholder efforts to improve maternal health. Study quality ranged from weak to strong. Measured health outcomes included increased antenatal care and facility birth. Improvements in human rights outcomes such as availability, acceptability, accessibility, quality of care, as well as the capacity of rights holders and duty bearers were also reported to varying extents. Very little information on costs and almost no information on harms or risks were described. Despite searching multiple sources of information, while some studies did report on activities to raise awareness of rights, few detailed how they did so and very few measured effects on health outcomes. Promoting awareness of rights is one element of increasing demand for and use of quality maternity care services for women during pregnancy, birth and after birth. To date efforts have not been well documented in the literature and the program theories, processes and costs, let alone health effects have not been well evaluated."
Do people with existing chronic conditions benefit from telephone coaching? A rapid review	"OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of telephone-based coaching services for the management of patients with chronic diseases. METHODS: A rapid scoping review of the published peer reviewed literature, using Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsychNet and Scopus. We included studies involving people aged 18 years or over with one or more of the following chronic conditions: type 2 diabetes, congestive cardiac failure, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension. Patients were identified as having multi-morbidity if they had an index chronic condition plus one or more other chronic condition. To be included in this review, the telephone coaching had to involve two-way conversations by telephone or video phone between a patient and a provider. Behaviour change, goal setting and empowerment are essential features of coaching. RESULTS: The review found 1756 papers, which was reduced to 30 after screening and relevance checks. Most coaching services were planned, as opposed to reactive, and targeted patients with complex needs who had one or more chronic disease. Several studies reported improvements in health behaviour, self-efficacy, health status and satisfaction with the service. More than one-third of the papers targeted vulnerable people and telephone coaching was found to be effective for these people. CONCLUSIONS: Telephone coaching for people with chronic conditions can improve health behaviour, self-efficacy and health status. This is especially true for vulnerable populations who had difficulty accessing health services. There is less evidence for improvements in quality of life and patient satisfaction with the service. The evidence for improvements in health service use was limited. This rapid scoping review found that telephone-based coaching can enhance the management of chronic disease, especially for vulnerable groups. Further work is needed to identify what models of telephone coaching are most effective according to patients' level of risk and co-morbidity. What is known about the topic? With the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases more demands are being made of limited health services and resources. Telephone health coaching for people with or at risk of chronic diseases is seen as a means of supporting people to manage their health and reducing the burden on the healthcare system. What does this paper add? Telephone coaching interventions were effective for vulnerable people with chronic disease(s). Often the vulnerable populations had worse control of their chronic condition at baseline and demonstrated the greatest improvement compared with those with better control at baseline. Planned (i.e. weekly or monthly telephone calls to support the patients with chronic disease) and unscripted telephone coaching interventions appear to be most effective for improving self-management skills in people from vulnerable groups: the planned telephone coaching services had the advantage of regular contact and helping people develop their skills over time, whereas the unscripted aspect allowed the coach to tailor support to the patient's individual needs What are the implications for practitioners? Telephone coaching is an effective means of supporting people with chronic diseases to manage their own health. Further work is needed to embed telephone coaching within existing services. Good linkages with the patient's general practitioner are important.

Does argumentation matter? A systematic literature review on the role of argumentation in doctor-patient communication	"In view of a growing interest in argumentative discourse in the context of patient-centered consultation and shared decision making, this article explores the role that argumentation has been attributed in the literature on doctor-patient consultation so far. It studies to what extent theories and concepts of argumentation have been applied by scholars from various fields in order to analyze, understand, facilitate, and improve the argumentative nature of medical consultation. It reports on an extensive and systematic literature search-using eight online databases, expert suggestions, and a manual search-and the subsequent evaluation of 1,330 abstracts on the basis of strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Forty relevant scientific contributions are grouped into four main categories and discussed accordingly: (a) argumentation theory, (b) discourse analysis, (c) medical informatics, and (d) medical ethics. Because of its systematic approach, this study forms a solid starting point for further integration of argumentation theoretical insights into contemporary views of patient-centered medicine and evidence-based medicine. It provides suggestions for further interdisciplinary and theory-driven research with a strong focus on empirical reality. Doing so, a preliminary model is proposed that outlines the potential effects of the quality of doctors' communication on proximal, intermediate, and long-term consultation outcomes."
Does it hurt to ask? A meta-analysis of participant reactions to trauma research.	"Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) are sometimes hesitant to approve trauma-related research due to concerns that asking participants about traumatic experiences will induce extreme distress. Despite the growing empirical literature examining participants' reactions to trauma-related research, no quantitative reviews have been conducted. The present multilevel meta-analysis was undertaken to quantify: (1) how participants react to trauma-related research overall; (2) to what extent reactions to trauma-related research differ by participant characteristics, including personal history of trauma, PTSD symptoms, and gender; and (3) to what extent (a) type of traumatic experience and (b) mode of administration moderate these effects. Studies examining adult participants' reactions to trauma assessments in the context of research were included. Results from 73,959 participants across 70 samples suggest that although trauma-related research can lead to some immediate psychological distress, this distress is not extreme. This distress is greater for individuals with a trauma history or PTSD, particularly in studies involving interviews. However, individuals generally find research participation to be a positive experience and do not regret participation, regardless of trauma history or PTSD. There were no gender differences in reactions. Present findings, which suggest that trauma-related research can continue without harming participants, may help inform IRB decisions on trauma research."
Does Shared Decision Making in Cancer Treatment Improve Quality of Life? A Systematic Literature Review	"BACKGROUND: The growing consensus espousing the use of shared decision making (SDM) in cancer treatment has coincided with the rise of health care evaluation paradigms that emphasize quality of life (QOL) as a central outcome measure. This review systematically examines the association between treatment SDM and QOL outcomes in cancer. METHODS: A range of bibliographic databases and gray literature sources was searched. The search retrieved 16,726 records, which were screened by title, abstract, and full text to identify relevant studies. The review included 17 studies with a range of study designs and populations. Data were extracted on study methods, participants, setting, study or intervention description, outcomes, main findings, secondary findings, and limitations. Quality appraisal was used, in conjunction with a narrative approach, to synthesize the evidence. RESULTS: The review found weak, but suggestive, evidence for a positive association between perceived patient involvement in decision making, a central dimension of SDM, and QOL outcomes in cancer. The review did not find evidence for an inverse association between SDM and QOL. The poor methodological quality and heterogeneity of the extant literature constrained the derived conclusions. In addition, the literature commonly treated various subscales of QOL instruments as separate outcomes, increasing the probability of spurious findings. CONCLUSIONS: There is weak evidence that aspects of shared decision-making approaches are positively associated with QOL outcomes and very little evidence of a negative association. The extant literature largely assessed patient involvement, only capturing one aspect of the shared decision-making construct, and is of poor quality, necessitating robust studies examining the association.

Does shared decision making results in better health related outcomes for individuals with painful musculoskeletal disorders? A systematic review.	"Background: Shared Decision-Making (SDM) is a dynamic process by which the health care professional and the patient influence each other in making health-related choices or decisions. SDM is strongly embedded in today's health care approaches, and is advocated as an ideal model since it renders individuals more control towards the health care they choose to receive, and has been shown to improve patient outcomes. Objectives: The goal of this systematic review was to investigate the added-value of SDM on clinical health-related outcomes in patients with a variety of musculoskeletal conditions. Data sources: PubMed and CINAHL. Study selection: PRISMA guidelines were followed for this review. To be considered for review, the study had to meet all the following criteria: (1) prospective studies that involved treatment decision-making; (2) randomized controlled trial design; (3) involving patients faced with having to make a treatment decision; (4) comparing SDM with a control intervention and (5) including one or more of the following outcome measures: well-being, costs, health-related pain or disability measures, or quality of life. Study appraisal: A priori, we determined to perform methodological quality assessment using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials. Results: We did not find a single study that looked at the true effect of SDM on patient reported outcomes in a population with musculoskeletal pain. Conclusion: For the management of painful musculoskeletal conditions, in the light of the current evidence (none), we estimate that it would be wise to explore the effectiveness of SDM before forcing its large-scale implementation in rehabilitation."
Does the engagement of clinicians and organisations in research improve healthcare performance: a three-stage review	"OBJECTIVE: There is a widely held assumption that engagement by clinicians and healthcare organisations in research improves healthcare performance at various levels, but little direct empirical evidence has previously been collated. The objective of this study was to address the question: Does research engagement (by clinicians and organisations) improve healthcare performance? METHODS: An hourglass-shaped review was developed, consisting of three stages: (1) a planning and mapping stage; (2) a focused review concentrating on the core question of whether or not research engagement improves healthcare performance; and (3) a wider (but less systematic) review of papers identified during the two earlier stages, focusing on mechanisms. RESULTS: Of the 33 papers included in the focused review, 28 identified improvements in health services performance. Seven out of these papers reported some improvement in health outcomes, with others reporting improved processes of care. The wider review demonstrated that mechanisms such as collaborative and action research can encourage some progress along the pathway from research engagement towards improved healthcare performance. Organisations that have deliberately integrated the research function into organisational structures demonstrate how research engagement can, among other factors, contribute to improved healthcare performance. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests that there is an association between the engagement of individuals and healthcare organisations in research and improvements in healthcare performance. The mechanisms through which research engagement might improve healthcare performance overlap and rarely act in isolation, and their effectiveness often depends on the context in which they operate.

Dog-assisted therapy in the treatment of people with chronic pain: A systematic review.	"Objective: Animal-assisted therapy is used in various ways to improve the quality of life of people with chronic pain. The aim of this work was to conduct a systematic review of the literature, and summarize what is known about this form of complementary therapy. Methods: A search was conducted in the following databases MEDLINE (via PubMed), CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, since its inception until January 2016. Results: A total of 179 items were found, and 135 were reviewed for potential inclusion in this study. Finally, we have included 7 articles. The results of the studies reported in these articles show that, in general, people who have participated in animal-assisted therapy report lower pain intensity, improved mood and overall better quality of life. Published reports do not provide detailed information about the type of intervention being used, nor its specific components, thus offering little possibility of replication. Conclusions: Reviewed studies show positive results, however these are based on poor designs. Future research with greater rigor and control is warranted. Future publications need to provide better descriptions of the interventions that are used, this is critical to identify which variables are ultimately responsible for the beneficial effects that are being reported."
Drinking water quality in Indigenous communities in Canada and health outcomes: a scoping review	"BACKGROUND: Many Indigenous communities in Canada live with high-risk drinking water systems and drinking water advisories and experience health status and water quality below that of the general population. A scoping review of research examining drinking water quality and its relationship to Indigenous health was conducted. OBJECTIVE: The study was undertaken to identify the extent of the literature, summarize current reports and identify research needs. DESIGN: A scoping review was designed to identify peer-reviewed literature that examined challenges related to drinking water and health in Indigenous communities in Canada. Key search terms were developed and mapped on five bibliographic databases (MEDLINE/PubMED, Web of Knowledge, SciVerse Scopus, Taylor and Francis online journal and Google Scholar). Online searches for grey literature using relevant government websites were completed. RESULTS: Sixteen articles (of 518; 156 bibliographic search engines, 362 grey literature) met criteria for inclusion (contained keywords; publication year 2000-2015; peer-reviewed and from Canada). Studies were quantitative (8), qualitative (5) or mixed (3) and included case, cohort, cross-sectional and participatory designs. In most articles, no definition of ""health"" was given (14/16), and the primary health issue described was gastrointestinal illness (12/16). Challenges to the study of health and well-being with respect to drinking water in Indigenous communities included irregular funding, remote locations, ethical approval processes, small sample sizes and missing data. CONCLUSIONS: Research on drinking water and health outcomes in Indigenous communities in Canada is limited and occurs on an opportunistic basis. There is a need for more research funding, and inquiry to inform policy decisions for improvements of water quality and health-related outcomes in Indigenous communities. A coordinated network looking at First Nations water and health outcomes, a database to store and create access to research findings, increased funding and time frames for funding, and more decolonizing and community-based participatory research aimed at understanding the relationship between drinking water quality and health outcomes in First Nations communities in Canada are needed."
Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) for young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).	"Background The rising prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) increases the need for evidence-based behavioral treatments to lessen the impact of symptoms on children's functioning. At present, there are no curative or psychopharmacological therapies to effectively treat all symptoms of the disorders. Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) is a treatment based on the principles of applied behavior analysis. Delivered for multiple years at an intensity of 20 to 40 hours per week, it is one of the more well-established treatments for ASD. This is an update of a Cochrane review last published in 2012. Objectives To systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of EIBI in increasing functional behaviors and skills, decreasing autism severity, and improving intelligence and communication skills for young children with ASD. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 12 additional electronic databases and two trials registers in August 2017. We also checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. Selection criteria Randomized control trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) in which EIBI was compared to a no-treatment or treatment-as-usual control condition. Participants must have been less than six years of age at treatment onset and assigned to their study condition prior to commencing treatment. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included five studies (one RCT and four CCTs) with a total of 219 children: 116 children in the EIBI groups and 103 children in the generic, special education services groups. The age of the children ranged between 30.2 months and 42.5 months. Three of the five studies were conducted in the USA and two in the UK, with a treatment duration of 24 months to 36 months. All studies used a treatment-as-usual comparison group. Authors' conclusions There is weak evidence that EIBI may be an effective behavioral treatment for some children with ASD; the strength of the evidence in this review is limited because it mostly comes from small studies that are not of the optimum design. Due to the inclusion of non-randomized studies, there is a high risk of bias and we rated the overall quality of evidence as 'low' or 'very low' using the GRADE system, meaning further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate."
Early interventions to promote work participation in people with regional musculoskeletal pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	"OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of early multidisciplinary interventions in promoting work participation and reducing work absence in adults with regional musculoskeletal pain. DATA SOURCES: Seven databases (CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, OT Seeker, PEDro; 1990 to December 2016) were searched for eligible studies. REVIEW METHODS: Trials were included if they reported on work-based outcomes for participants experiencing difficulties at work or <= three months' sick leave. Interventions had to include two or more elements of the biopsychosocial model delivered as a coordinated programme. Quality was assessed using the GRADE criteria. Results were analysed by hazard ratios for return to work data; continuous outcomes were analysed as standardised mean difference with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: A total of 20 randomized controlled trials, with 16,319 participants were included; the interventions were grouped according to their main components for meta-analyses. At 12-months follow-up, moderate quality evidence suggests that programmes involving a stepped care approach (four studies) were more effective than the comparisons in promoting return to work (hazard ratio (HR) 1.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.61), p = 0.03), whereas case management (two studies) was not (HR 0.92 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.24), p = 0.59). Analyses suggested limited effectiveness in reducing sickness absences, in pain reduction or functional improvement across the intervention categories. CONCLUSION: There is uncertainty as to the effectiveness of early multicomponent interventions owing to the clinical heterogeneity and varying health and social insurance systems across the trials."

Education for contraceptive use by women after childbirth.	"Background Contraceptive education is generally a standard component of postpartum care, although the effectiveness is seldom examined. The assumptions that form the basis of such programs include postpartum women being motivated to use contraception and that they will not return to a health provider for family planning advice. Women may wish to discuss contraception both prenatally and after hospital discharge. Nonetheless, two-thirds of postpartum women have unmet needs for contraception. In the USA, many adolescents have repeat pregnancies within a year of giving birth. Objectives Assess the effectiveness of educational interventions for postpartum women on contraceptive use Search methods We searched for trials through June 2015 in PubMed, CENTRAL, CINAHL, POPLINE, and Web of Science. For current trials, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. Previous searches also included EMBASE and PsycInfo. We also examined reference lists of relevant articles. For earlier versions, we contacted investigators to locate additional reports. Selection criteria We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined postpartum education about contraceptive use, whether delivered to individuals or to groups of women. Studies that randomized clusters rather than individuals were eligible if the investigators accounted for the clustering in the analysis. The intervention must have started within one month after delivery. Data collection and analysis We assessed titles and abstracts identified during the literature searches. The data were abstracted and entered into Review Manager. Studies were examined for methodological quality. For dichotomous outcomes, the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. Where data were sFor continuous variables, we computed the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. Due to varied interventions and outcome measures, we did not conduct meta-analysis. Main results Twelve trials met our eligibility criteria, included the three added in this update. The studies included a total of 4145 women. Eight trials were conducted in the USA; the others were from Australia, Nepal, Pakistan, and Syria. Four studies provided one session before hospital discharge; three had structured counseling of varying intensity and one involved informal counseling. Of eight interventions with than one contact, five focused on adolescents. Three of the five involved home visiting, one provided multiple clinic services, and one had in-person contact and phone follow-up. Of the remaining three for women of varying ages, two involved home visits and one provided phone follow-up. Authors' conclusions We focused our results summary on trials with moderate or high quality evidence. Overall, the overall quality of evidence in this review was moderate to low and the evidence of effectiveness was mostly low quality. The interventions could be improved by strengthening the program design and implementation. Some studies did not report program training for providers, adherence to the intervention protocol, or measurement of participants' knowledge and skills. Many trials did not have an objective outcome measure, i.e., pregnancy test or structured questionnaire for contraceptive use. Valid and reliable outcome measures are needed to obtain meaningful results. Still, given the associated costs and logistics, some programs would not be feasible in many settings."
Educational approaches focusing on the quality of life of people with chronic kidney disease receiving hemodialysis: an integrative review	"Introduction: The impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on the quality of life of patients receiving hemodi- alysis is widely studied. Despite the vast amount of literature on the topic, it is still important to investigate the educational approaches related to this population's quality of life, evolution, and treatment. Objective: To systematically review the literature on educational approaches focusing on people with CKD receiving hemodialysis. Methods: An integrative systematic review of studies published between 2010 and 2015 was conducted using the PubMed, LILACS, PROQUEST, SCIENCEDIRECT, and SciELO databases using the keywords ""quality of life and hemodialysis and adults"", with their translation equivalents in Portuguese and Spanish. Results: The studies included in this review investigated biological conditions, treatment adherence, psychosocial conditions, and even spiritual influence. These studies unanimously recognized the validity of educational approaches, be it for treatment adherence, actor's empowerment, or self-knowledge, as well as the importance of addressing a wider patient view and participatory therapy planning. Conclusion: The quality of life of people with CKD is a widely and differently studied topic, but the number of educational approaches focusing on this group of patients is modest and poorly represented in the existing literature. The few studies that address this topic are in complete agreement about the importance and relevance of educational approaches for people with CKD. We conclude that patient adherence, participation, and empowerment should be considered and encouraged.; Introdu?ß?£o: Qualidade de vida ?© tema amplamente estudado, como forma de compreender as repercuss?µes causadas na vida das pessoas com doen?ßa renal cr?¥nica - DRC em hemodi?°lise.

Educational Interventions in the Promotion of Healthy Eating in Schools	"Objective: to identify the types of educational interventions in promoting healthy eating in schoolchildren. Method: integrative review between January 2010 and May 2018, in which articles were selected in Portuguese, English and Spanish in the databases PUBMED / MEDLINE, CINAHL, LILACS, BDENF, SCOPUS, CUIDEN, COCHRANE, WEB of SCIENCE, IBECS and in the SciELO virtual library. Data was categorized in relation to the types of technologies and the topics addressed. Results: the sample was constituted by 17 articles, five of which dealt with healthy eating practices; four, prevention of overweight and obesity and eight, food and nutritional security. All have used lightweight and light-hard technologies and six, hard technology. Several educational interventions were used. Conclusion: in order to carry out educational interventions, various resources are used, from the simplest to the most sophisticated, and their effectiveness will be based on the involvement of the school community and the effective participation of parents or guardians. The school environment can be considered as the important place for promoting health through the acquisition of good eating habits.; Objetivo: identificar los tipos de intervenciones educativas en la promoci??n de la alimentaci??n sana en los escolares.

"Effect of Active Lessons on Physical Activity, Academic, and Health Outcomes: A Systematic Review"	"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of classroom-based physical activity interventions that integrate academic content and assess the effectiveness of the interventions on physical activity, learning, facilitators of learning, and health outcomes. METHOD: Six electronic databases (ERIC, PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE) and reference lists were searched for English-language articles, published January 1990 through March 2015, reporting classroom-based interventions that deliberately taught academic content using physically active teaching methods for at least 1 week duration, with physical activity, health, learning, or facilitators-of-learning outcomes. Two authors reviewed full-text articles. Data were extracted onto an Excel spreadsheet, and authors were contacted to confirm accuracy of the information presented. RESULTS: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Six studies reporting on physical activity levels were found to have medium-to-large effect sizes. All 4 studies reporting learning outcomes showed positive effects of intervention lessons. Teachers and students were pleased with the programs, and enhanced on-task behavior was identified (n = 3). Positive effects were also reported on students' body mass index levels (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: Physically active academic lessons increase physical activity levels and may benefit learning and health outcomes. Both students and teachers positively received and enjoyed these teaching methods. These findings emphasize the need for such interventions to contribute toward public health policy."
Effect of Assertive Community Treatment for Patients with Substance Use Disorder: A Systematic Review	"PURPOSE: Substance use disorders (SUD) are an important health issue internationally. Traditional outpatient programmes often do not adequately address the substantial medical and social needs and in addition many patients have difficulties accessing the care needed. The assertive community treatment (ACT) model was originally developed for patients with a severe mental illness but has been adapted for patients with SUD by integrating specific SUD treatments into the traditional ACT model. This paper aims to assess the effectiveness of ACT for patients with SUD on a number of measures. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of ACT interventions for patients with SUD by analyzing randomized controlled studies published before June 2017 found on the electronic databases PsychINFO, MEDLINE, PsychARTICLES. Eleven publications using 5 datasets were included in the analysis. Quality of studies was analyzed using the JADAD scale or Oxford quality scoring system. Outcome measures used were substance use, treatment engagement, hospitalization rates, quality of life, housing status, medication compliance and legal problems. Patients included in the studies had a diagnosis of SUD. Two datasets included homeless patients and 2 datasets included patients with high service use. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results of the very few existing randomized control studies are mixed. Treatment engagement was higher for ACT in 4 datasets. One dataset reported higher service contact rates for the ACT group than for controls. In 2 datasets a positive effect on hospitalization rates was found. Higher fidelity to the ACT model appears to improve outcomes. Substance use reduced only in half of the datasets, of which only one showed a significant reduction in the ACT group. Overall, ACT is a promising approach that may be useful for promoting treatment engagement for patients with SUD. According to earlier studies on patients with severe mental illness, patients with high inpatient service use benefit most from this assertive approach. We hypothesize that a similar high need user group among patients with SUD might benefit most from ACT. Further research is needed to examine which types of clinical interventions might help difficult-to-engage patients with addictions. Copyright ¬© 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel."
Effect of Home- and Community-Based Physical Activity Interventions on Physical Function Among Cancer Survivors: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	"OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of home- and community-based physical activity interventions on physical functioning among cancer survivors based on the most prevalent physical function measures, randomized trials were reviewed. DATA SOURCES: Five electronic databases-Medline Ovid, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and PsycINFO-were searched from inception to March 2016 for relevant articles. STUDY SELECTION: Search terms included community-based interventions, physical functioning, and cancer survivors. A reference librarian trained in systematic reviews conducted the final search. DATA EXTRACTION: Four reviewers evaluated eligibility and 2 reviewers evaluated methodological quality. Data were abstracted from studies that used the most prevalent physical function measurement tools-Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument, European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire, and 6-minute walk test. Random- or fixed-effects models were conducted to obtain overall effect size per physical function measure. DATA SYNTHESIS: Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria and were used to compute standardized mean differences using the inverse variance statistical method. The median sample size was 83 participants. Most of the studies (n=7) were conducted among breast cancer survivors. The interventions produced short-term positive effects on physical functioning, with overall effect sizes ranging from small (.17; 95% confidence interval CI], .07-.27) to medium (.45; 95% CI, .23-.67). Community-based interventions that met in groups and used behavioral change strategies produced the largest effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Home and community-based physical activity interventions may be a potential tool to combat functional deterioration among aging cancer survivors. More studies are needed among other cancer types using clinically relevant objective functional measures (eg, gait speed) to accelerate translation into the community and clinical practice.

Effect of nutrition interventions on diet-related and health outcomes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians: a systematic review.	"OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on nutrition interventions and identify which work to improve diet-related and health outcomes in Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review of peer-reviewed literature. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Science Direct, CINAHL, Informit, PsychInfo and Cochrane Library, Australian Indigenous Health InfoNet. STUDY SELECTION: Peer-reviewed article describing an original study; published in English prior to December 2017; inclusion of one or more of the following outcome measures: nutritional status, food/dietary/nutrient intake, diet-related biomedical markers, anthropometric or health measures; and conducted with Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers extracted data and applied the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies from the Effective Public Health Practice Project. A purpose designed tool assessed community engagement in research, and a framework was applied to interventions to report a score based on numbers of settings and strategies. Heterogeneity of studies precluded a meta-analysis. The effect size of health outcome results were estimated and presented as forest plots. RESULTS: Thirty-five articles (26 studies) met inclusion criteria; two rated moderate in quality; 12 described cohort designs; 18 described interventions in remote/very remote communities; none focused solely on urban communities; and 11 reported moderate or strong community engagement. Six intervention types were identified. Statistically significant improvements were reported in 14 studies of which eight reported improvements in biochemical/haematological markers and either anthropometric and/or diet-related outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Store-based intervention with community health promotion in very remote communities, fiscal strategies and nutrition education and promotion programmes show promise. Future dietary intervention studies must be rigorously evaluated, provide intervention implementation details explore scale up of programmes, include urban communities and consider a multisetting and strategy approach. Strong Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community engagement is essential for effective nutrition intervention research and evaluation. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42015029551.

Effectiveness and characteristics of multifaceted osteoporosis group education--a systematic review	"UNLABELLED: The characteristics and effectiveness of osteoporosis multifaceted group education were determined from a systematic review of international literature. Findings showed that these educational programmes may be beneficial in a variety of important factors for the prevention, treatment and management of osteoporosis. INTRODUCTION: This systematic review investigated quantitative studies on osteoporosis multifaceted group education. The purpose was to investigate the characteristics as well as the effectiveness of this form of osteoporosis patient education. METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guided this systematic review. Relevant databases were searched until January 2013. RESULTS: Seven studies published between 1993 and 2011 including osteoporosis patients with or without fractures were found. The multifaceted educational programmes all consisted of three overall themes: (1) Knowledge of osteoporosis, (2) Medication and diet and (3) Exercise, but with different foci across the studies. Overall, 24 outcome measures representing six topics were applied: (1) Health-related quality of life, (2) Psychosocial function, (3) Pain, (4) Physical activity, (5) Knowledge and (6) Medication and diet. The review showed that multifaceted osteoporosis group education can increase the patients' knowledge of osteoporosis as well as their health-related quality of life, physical activity and psychosocial functioning. It has the potential to increase adherence to both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Multifaceted group education may have a positive impact on the patients' ability to engage in preventing and managing osteoporosis. Further research directed towards the complexity of multifaceted group education is needed. In addition, research investigating the educational needs of specific groups of osteoporotic patients is required."
Effectiveness and experiences of families and support workers participating in peer-led parenting support programs delivered as home visiting programs: a comprehensive systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Designing child and family health services to meet the diverse needs of contemporary families is intended to minimize impacts of early disadvantage and subsequent lifelong health and social issues. Innovative programs to engage families with child and family support services have led to interest in the potential value of peer-led home visiting from parents in local communities. There is a range of benefits and challenges identified in a limited number of studies associated with home visiting peer support. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the review is to identify: INCLUSION CRITERIA PARTICIPANTS: Families/parents with one or more children aged zero to four years, peer support workers and their supervisors. INTERVENTION AND PHENOMENON OF INTEREST: Peer-led home visiting parenting support programs that use volunteer or paraprofessional home visitors from the local community compared to standard community maternal-child care. The phenomenon of interest will be the relationships between participants in the program. TYPES OF STUDIES: Quantitative studies: randomized control trials (RCTs). Qualitative studies: grounded theory and qualitative descriptive studies. OUTCOMES: Parental attitudes and beliefs, coping skills and confidence in parenting, parental stress, compliance with child health checks/links with primary healthcare services, satisfaction with peer support and services and the nature of the relationship between parents and home visitors. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy will include both published and unpublished studies. Seven journal databases and five other sources will be searched. Only studies published in the English language from 2000 to 2015 will be considered. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Studies were assessed by two independent reviewers using standardized critical appraisal tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) and the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI) as appropriate. DATA EXTRACTION: Both quantitative and qualitative data were independently extracted by two reviewers using standardized data extraction tools from the JBI-MAStARI and the JBI-QARI, respectively, including qualitative and quantitative details about setting of interventions, phenomena of interest, participants, study methods and outcomes or findings. DATA SYNTHESIS: For quantitative findings, statistical pooling was not possible due to differences in interventions and outcome measures. Findings were presented in narrative form. Qualitative findings were aggregated into categories based on similarity of meaning from which synthesized findings were generated. RESULTS: Quantitative results from two RCTs demonstrated positive impacts of peer-led home visiting parent support programs including more positive parenting attitudes and beliefs, and more child preventative health care visits.Fifteen qualitative findings from two studies were aggregated into five categories from which two synthesized findings emerged. Parents and home visitors identified similar components as contributing to their program's success, these being quality of relationships between parents and home visitors with elements being mutual respect, trust and being valued within the partnership. In addition, home visitors identified importance of enabling strategies to develop relationships. They also needed supportive working environments with clinical staff and management. CONCLUSION: The current review indicates a positive impact of peer-led home visiting parent support programs, incorporating a framework of partnership between parents and home visitors, on mother-infant dyads. Positive changes in parenting attitudes and beliefs, and increased number of child preventative healthcare visits are supported by the quality of the relationship between parent and home visitor, and home visitors' working environments. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The essential characteristics of an effective parent support program are strategies for relationship building between parents and home visitors; ongoing staff and home visitor education to enhance communication, collaboration and working in partnership; supervision by team leaders; and continuous quality improvement. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: The focus of further research should be on confirmatory studies using an action research methodology and the cost-effectiveness of these models."
Effectiveness of Adolescent Peer Education Programs on Reducing HIV/STI Risk: An Integrated Review	"There is empirical evidence suggesting that peer education is efficacious in changing adolescent sexual risk behaviors; however, it is unclear if there are similarities in outcomes across studies. Thus, the purpose of this review was to synthesize published research on peer-led HIV/STI intervention programs for adolescents in an effort to determine the efficacy of peer education on knowledge, attitudes, normative beliefs, and sexual behavior. Data collection included online searches of published research from Index Medicus (Medline), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), Educational Index, and PsycINFO (including PsycARTICLES) from 2000 to 2016. Twenty-four quantitative and six qualitative studies were included in the review. There appears to be evidence of the effectiveness of adolescent peer-led HIV education programs on knowledge, attitudes, normative beliefs, and self-efficacy. However, the studies reviewed were equivocal on changes in sexual behavior. The findings of the qualitative/process studies demonstrated perceived program efficacy among staff and peer educators. Peer educators and students placed a high value on peer-led programs. Mediators and/or covariates such as culture, gender, sexual experience, and age may impact findings of adolescent peer intervention studies; therefore, these factors need to be considered when implementing and evaluating peer education programs. Peer education should also focus on variables that were gleaned from qualitative studies, such as the role of the community and altruistic roles."
Effectiveness of individual strategies for the empowerment of patients with diabetes mellitus: A systematic review with meta-analysis.	"AIMS: To identify and evaluate the effectiveness of individual empowerment strategies in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: A systematic review was performed in the PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct and BVS. For meta-analysis and evaluation of Cochrane Risk and Bias, Revman V 5.2 software was used. RESULTS: Eleven studies of 1073 publications met the inclusion criteria. The strategies used were individual consultations, phone calls, sessions via a website and use of a booklet. Glycemic Hemoglobin (HbA1c) was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies, and 45.4% of the studies also used the Diabetes Empowerment Scale. Five studies (45.5%) showed significant improvements in HbA1c reduction, improvements in self-efficacy (18.2%), knowledge levels of DM (18.2%), quality of life (18.2%). However, after meta-analysis, no statistically significant improvement was found for HbA1c. CONCLUSION: This systematic review showed that individual strategies for DM empowerment were not effective in reducing HbA1c, despite contributing to improvements in psychosocial parameters. Therefore, individual strategies need to be reviewed so that they become effective in DM control. Copyright ¬© 2017 Primary Care Diabetes Europe. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Effectiveness of knowledge translation and knowledge appropriation of clinical practice guidelines for patients and communities, a systematic review."	"Introduction: Knowledge translation and knowledge appropriation social interventions apply knowledge to improve health services and outcomes. These interventions can be implemented routinely to improve patient adherence to clinical practice guidelines. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of knowledge translation interventions to improve patient and community adherence to clinical practice guidelines. Materials and methods: We performed a systematic review of these interventions compared with classical interventions for patients and/or communities. We searched the following electronic databases up to April 2017: Medline (Ovid), Embase, Scopus, Central (Ovid), Web of Science, LILACS, Academic Search, and Scielo. Two independent raters qualified the relevance, risk of bias, and quality of included studies. Results: Eight studies were included. Patient adherence to recommendations was observed in two studies. There was high heterogeneity due to the variability of the population, types of guidelines, and types of measurement tools. The risk of bias was high: a 60% risk of performance bias, 50% risk of attrition bias, 25% risk of selection and reporting bias, and 15% risk of detection bias. The quality of evidence was moderate for the outcomes of adherence and mortality. The interventions that used a combination of strategies, such as with the group of health professionals, could improve some clinical outcomes in the patients (Average deviation: -3.00; 95% IC: -6.08-0.08). Conclusions: Knowledge translation interventions might have a slight positive effect on patient adherence and some short-term clinical outcomes, particularly within mixed interventions (patients and health professionals). However, future studies with less heterogeneity are necessary to confirm these results."
Effectiveness of multicultural health workers in chronic disease prevention and self-management in culturally and linguistically diverse populations: A systematic literature review.	"With a large and increasing culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) population, the Australian health care system faces challenges in the provision of accessible culturally competent health care. Communities at higher risk of chronic disease include CALD communities. Overseas, multicultural health workers (MHWs) have been increasingly integrated in the delivery of culturally relevant primary health care to CALD communities. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the effectiveness of MHW interventions in chronic disease prevention and self-management in CALD populations with the aim to inform policy development of effective health care in CALD communities in Australia. A systematic review protocol was developed and computerised searches were conducted of multiple electronic databases from 1 January 1995 until 1 November 2010. Thirty-nine studies were identified including 31 randomised controlled trials. Many of the studies focussed on poor and underserved ethnic minorities. Several studies reported significant improvements in participants' chronic disease prevention and self-management outcomes and meta-analyses identified a positive trend associated with MHW intervention. Australian Government policies express the need for targeted inventions for CALD communities. The broader systemic application of MHWs in Australian primary health care may provide one of the most useful targeted interventions for CALD communities. ¬© 2013 La Trobe University."
Effectiveness of peers in delivering programs or motivating older people to increase heir participation in physical activity: Systematic review and meta-analysis	"The objective of this systematic review and metaanalysis was -to evaluate the effectiveness of peers to deliver programs or encourage older people to be physically active and improve physical outcomes. Peer reviewed articles published in English between January 1976 and June 2016, retrieved from six databases according to the predefined inclusion criteria were included. Where possible results were pooled and meta-analyses conducted. Eighteen articles were included in the review, a total of 3,492 intervention participants, average age 66.5 years and 67.1% were female. Overall, study quality was medium to high. Interventions mainly included resistance, flexibility and cardiovascular training, however there was one aquatic exercise group. Eight studies were delivered by peers and five utilised peer support, which included advice and being positive but was not directly linked to an exercise intervention. While 16 of the 18 studies reported improvement in levels of physical activity and/or noted physical benefits by peer involvement, the meta-analyses findings supported the control groups for the six-minute-walk-test and the timed-up-and-go test. Findings from this review suggest exercise programs involving peers can promote and maintain adherence to exercise programs. However, results were inconclusive as to whether peers have a positive effect on improving older people's physical function."
Effects of community participation on improving uptake of skilled care for maternal and newborn health: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Despite a broad consensus that communities should be actively involved in improving their own health, evidence for the effect of community participation on specific health outcomes is limited. We examine the effectiveness of community participation interventions in maternal and newborn health, asking: did participation improve outcomes? We also look at how the impact of community participation has been assessed, particularly through randomised controlled trials, and make recommendations for future research. We highlight the importance of qualitative investigation, suggesting key areas for qualitative data reporting alongside quantitative work. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Systematic review of published and 'grey' literature from 1990. We searched 11 databases, and followed up secondary references. Main outcome measures were the use of skilled care before/during/after birth and maternal/newborn mortality/morbidity. We included qualitative and quantitative studies from any country, and used a community participation theoretical framework to analyse the data. We found 10 interventions. Community participation had largely positive impacts on maternal/newborn health as part of a package of interventions, although not necessarily on uptake of skilled care. Interventions improving mortality or use of skilled care raised awareness, encouraged dialogue and involved communities in designing solutions-but so did those showing no effect. DISCUSSION: There are few high-quality, quantitative studies. We also lack information about why participation interventions do/do not succeed - an area of obvious interest for programme designers. Qualitative investigation can help fill this information gap and should be at the heart of future quantitative research examining participation interventions - in maternal/newborn health, and more widely. This review illustrates the need for qualitative investigation alongside RCTs and other quantitative studies to understand complex interventions in context, describe predicted and unforeseen impacts, assess potential for generalisability, and capture the less easily measurable social/political effects of encouraging participation."
Effects of front-of-package and shelf nutrition labeling systems on consumers	"As standards are considered for nutrition front-of-package (FOP) and shelf-labeling systems in the United States, it is important to know what types of systems are most effective in conveying scientifically accurate and useful information to consumers. A systematic literature review identified 38 empirical studies on consumer response to FOP nutrition labeling and shelf labeling. Studies indicate that consumers can more easily interpret and select healthier products with nutrient-specific FOP nutrition labels that incorporate text and symbolic color to indicate nutrient levels rather than nutrient-specific labels that only emphasize numeric information, such as Guideline Daily Amounts expressed as percentages and/or grams. Summary systems may influence consumers to purchase healthier products. However, more research is needed to assess the influence of nutrient-specific labels on consumers' purchases. This review identified few studies that compared consumers' ability to select healthier products using nutrient-specific systems that incorporate text and color codes with multiple-level summary icons. More research is needed to determine the effects of FOP nutrition labeling on consumers' actual shopping behaviors and dietary intakes. Copyright ¬© 2013 International Life Sciences Institute."
Effects of Peer-Led Interventions for Patients With Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.	"PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION: To evaluate the effects of peer-led supportive interventions for patients with cancer.. LITERATURE SEARCH: Six electronic databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, ProQuest Medical Library, and CINAHL) were searched for articles published from 1997 to May 2017.. DATA EVALUATION: A total of 159 studies were identified. Eighteen (16 randomized, controlled trials RCTs] and 2 non-RCTs) were eligible for systematic review and 16 for meta-analysis. The Cochrane risk of bias tool and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software were used for analysis.. SYNTHESIS: The authors synthesized the results of the effect size of each trial according to cancer symptoms, coping, emotional health, quality of life, self-efficacy, sexuality, social support, and health-related behaviors. . IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: The findings from this study suggest that an additional tiered evaluation that has a theoretical underpinning and high-quality methodology is required to confirm the efficacy of peer-led supportive interventions within cancer care models."

A systematic scoping review of the evidence for consumer involvement in organisations undertaking systematic reviews: focus on Cochrane.	"Plain English summary: Cochrane is the largest international producer of systematic reviews of clinical trial evidence. We looked for published evidence that reports where consumers (patients and the public) have been involved in Cochrane systematic reviews, and also in reviews published by other organisations.We found 36 studies that reported about consumer involvement either in individual systematic reviews, or in other organisations. The studies showed that consumers were involved in reviews in a range of different ways: coordinating and producing reviews, making reviews more accessible, and spreading the results of reviews (""knowledge transfer""). The most common role was commenting on reviews (""peer reviewing""). Consumers also had other general roles, for example in educating people about evidence or helping other consumers. There were some interesting examples of new ways of involving consumers. The studies showed that most consumers came from rich and English speaking countries. There was little evidence about how consumer involvement had changed the reviews (""impact""). The studies found that consumer involvement needed to be properly supported.In future we believe that more research should be done to understand what kind of consumer involvement has the best impact; that more review authors should report how consumers have been involved; and that consumers who help with reviews should come from more varied backgrounds. Abstract: Background Cochrane is the largest international producer of systematic reviews, and is committed to consumer involvement in the production and dissemination of its reviews. The review aims to systematically scope the evidence base for consumer involvement in organisations which commission, undertake or support systematic reviews; with an emphasis on Cochrane. Methods In June 2015 we searched six databases and other sources for studies of consumer involvement in organisations which commission, undertake or support systematic reviews, or in individual systematic review processes. All types of reports and evaluations were eligible. Included studies were combined in a narrative synthesis structured by the level of evaluation and the type of involvement. Results We identified 36 relevant studies. Eleven of these were evaluations at the level of a whole organisation; seven of these studied consumer involvement in Cochrane. Ten studies examined individual Cochrane review groups. Twelve studies reported on individual reviews; only two of these were Cochrane reviews. Finally, three studies were themselves syntheses of other studies. The included studies reported varying levels of consumer involvement across a wide range of activities related to review design and conduct. These included activities such as priority setting and outcome definition as well as review-specific roles such as acting as peer referees and producing plain language summaries. The level of satisfaction and awareness of impact was generally higher in studies focused on individual Cochrane review groups than in the organisation-wide studies. Conclusions There was evidence of highly variable levels and types of consumer involvement within and beyond Cochrane, but limited evidence for what makes the most effective methods and levels of involving consumers in review production. Where evidence of impact was found at the level of individual reviews and review groups it underlined the need for properly resourced and supported processes in order to derive the greatest benefit from the lived experiences of consumers who are willing to be involved. Where reviews do involve consumers, their contribution to the final result could be more clearly identified. More rigorous evaluations are needed to determine the best approach to achieving this.

Email for the provision of information on disease prevention and health promotion	"BACKGROUND: Email is a popular and commonly used method of communication, but its use in health care is not routine. Its application in health care has included the provision of information on disease prevention and health promotion, but the effects of using email in this way are not known. This review assesses the use of email for the provision of information on disease prevention and health promotion. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of email for the provision of information on disease prevention and health promotion, compared to standard mail or usual care, on outcomes for healthcare professionals, patients and caregivers, and health services, including harms. SEARCH METHODS: We searched: the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group Specialised Register (January 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1 2010), MEDLINE (1950 to January 2010), EMBASE (1980 to January 2010), CINAHL (1982 to February 2010), ERIC (1965 to January 2010) and PsycINFO (1967 to January 2010). We searched grey literature: theses/dissertation repositories, trials registers and Google Scholar (searched July 2010). We used additional search methods: examining reference lists, contacting authors. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series studies examining interventions where email is used by healthcare professionals to provide information to patients on disease prevention and health promotion, and taking the form of 1) unsecured email 2) secure email or 3) web messaging. We considered healthcare professionals or associated administrative staff as participants originating the email communication, and patients and caregivers as participants receiving the email communication, in all settings. Email communication was one-way from healthcare professionals or associated administrative staff originating the email communication, to patients or caregivers receiving the email communication. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed risk of bias according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For continuous outcome measures, we report effect sizes as mean differences (MDs). For dichotomous outcome measures, we report effect sizes as odds ratios (ORs). We conducted a meta-analysis for one primary health service outcome, comparing email communication to standard mail, and report this result as an OR. MAIN RESULTS: We included six randomised controlled trials involving 8372 people. All trials were judged to be at high risk of bias for at least one domain. Four trials compared email communication to standard mail and two compared email communication to usual care. For the primary health service outcome of uptake of preventive screening, there was no difference between email and standard mail (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.24). For both comparisons (email versus standard mail and email versus usual care) there was no difference between the groups for patient or caregiver understanding and support. Results were inconclusive for patient or caregiver behaviours and actions. For email versus usual care only, there was no significant difference between groups for the primary outcome of patient health status and well-being. No data were reported relating to healthcare professionals or harms. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence on the use of email for the provision of information on disease prevention and health promotion was weak, and therefore inadequate to inform clinical practice. The available trials mostly provide inconclusive, or no evidence for the outcomes of interest in this review. Future research needs to use high-quality study designs that take advantage of the most recent developments in information technology, with consideration of the complexity of email as an intervention."
Enablers and barriers in providing telediabetes services for Indigenous communities: A systematic review	"A systematic review of studies which reported on telediabetes services within Indigenous communities was undertaken in June 2016. The aim of this study was to identify enablers and barriers associated with the delivery of telehealth services for diabetes care amongst Indigenous people. A total of 14 articles met the study inclusion criteria, reporting work in Canada, Australia, India, and the US. Key enablers included the use of cultural and spiritual elements, acknowledgement of local beliefs and traditions, and appropriate community engagement. The involvement of Indigenous health workers was also very important because of their role in communication in local language, helping clinicians understand the community, and the transportation of patients. The main barriers associated with telediabetes services were the potentially high fail-to-attend rates, lack of technical skills associated with the operation of telehealth equipment, and the lack of availability of local staff. Knowledge of the enablers and barriers associated with the delivery of healthcare services to Indigenous communities is important when planning a telediabetes service.

Enablers and Barriers to Community Engagement in Public Health Emergency Preparedness: A Literature Review	"Public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) all too often focusses only on institutional capabilities, including their technical expertise and political influence, while overlooking community capabilities. However, the success of institutional emergency preparedness plans depends upon communities and institutions working together to ensure successful anticipation, response and recovery. Broader community engagement is therefore recommended worldwide. This literature review was carried out to identify enablers and barriers to community and institutional synergies in emergency preparedness. Searches were undertaken across bibliographic databases and grey literature sources. The literature identified was qualitative in nature. A qualitative, 'best fit' framework approach using a pre-existing framework was used to analyse the literature, whereby themes were added and changed as analysis progressed. A working definition of community was identified, based on a 'whole community' approach, inclusive of the whole multitude of stakeholders including community residents and emergency management staff. Given the diversity in community make-up, the types of emergencies that could be faced, the socio-economic, environmental and political range of communities, there are no set practices that will be effective for all communities. The most effective way of engaging communities in emergency preparedness is context-dependent and the review did draw out some important key messages for institutions to consider."
End-user involvement in a systematic review of quantitative and qualitative research of non-pharmacological interventions for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder delivered in school settings: reflections on the impacts and challenges.	"BACKGROUND: The benefits of end-user involvement in health-care research are widely recognized by research agencies. There are few published evaluations of end-user involvement in systematic reviews. OBJECTIVES: (i) Describe end-user involvement in a complex mixed-methods systematic review of ADHD in schools, (ii) reflect on the impact of end-user involvement, (iii) highlight challenges and benefits experienced and (iv) provide suggestions to inform future involvement. METHODS: End-users were involved in all stages of the project, both as authors and as members of an advisory group. In addition, several events were held with groups of relevant end-users during the project. RESULTS: End-user input (i) guided the direction of the research, (ii) contributed to a typology of interventions and outcomes, (iii) contributed to the direction of data analysis and (iv) contributed to the robustness of the syntheses by demonstrating the alignment of interim findings with lived experiences. Challenges included (i) managing expectations, (ii) managing the intensity of emotion, (iii) ensuring that involvement was fruitful for all not just the researcher, (iv) our capacity to communicate and manage the process and (v) engendering a sense of involvement amongst end-users. CONCLUSIONS: End-user involvement was an important aspect of this project. To minimize challenges in future projects, a recognition by the project management team and the funding provider that end-user involvement even in evidence synthesis projects is resource intensive is essential to allow appropriate allocation of time and resources for meaningful engagement.

Engagement of stakeholders in the development of a Theory of Change for handwashing and sanitation behaviour change	"A Theory of Change (ToC) is an approach to map programmes aimed at inducing change in a specific context, with the goal of increasing their impact. We applied this approach to the specific case of handwashing and sanitation practices in low- and middle-income countries and developed a ToC as part of a systematic review exercise. Different existing sources of information were used to inform the initial draft of the ToC. In addition, stakeholder involvement occurred and peer review took place. Our stakeholders included methodological (ToC/quantitative and qualitative research) and content experts (WASH (Water, Sanitation, Hygiene)/behaviour change), as well as end-users/practitioners, policy-makers and donors. In conclusion, the development of a ToC, and the involvement of stakeholders in its development, was critical in terms of understanding the context in which the promotional programmes are being implemented. We recommend ToC developers to work with stakeholders to create a ToC relevant for practice."
Engaging African American women in research: an approach to eliminate health disparities in the African American community	"Objective: To explore the success of community-based participatory research CBPR] in engaging African American women to achieve health equity by elucidating community, trust, communication and impact. Recommendations helpful for researchers interested in engaging communities to achieve health equity in the USA are included.Inroduction: African American women experience health disparities of multifactorial etiology and are underrepresented in research. CBPR is a collaborative approach that incorporates perspectives, which address the intricate determinants of health and has been reported as an effective means to address health disparities. Yet, the science of CBPR seems elusive to researchers in the medical field. The opportunity exists to better understand and expand the use of the principles of engagement, replication, and sustainability in engaging African American women in health research.Methods: A variety of literature regarding engaging African American women in community-based participatory research was reviewed.Results: CBPR focused on robust engagement of marginalized groups continues to be validated as a vital approach to the elimination of disparities and improved health for all, especially ethnic and racial minority populations. However, limited evidence of focused engagement of African American women was found. Making specific outreach to African American women must be a community and patient engagement priority to achieve health equity.Conclusions: Continued research is needed which specifically focuses on building and sustaining engagement with African American women and their communities. This research can transform healthcare access, experiences and outcomes by yielding actionable information about what African American women need and want to promote wellness for themselves and their communities."
Engaging hepatitis C infected patients in cost-effectiveness analyses: A literature review.	"Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment strategies have become common, but few appear to include patient engagement or the patient perspective. The objectives of the current study were to (1) identify published HCV CEA studies that include patient input and (2) derive insights on patient-informed variable and outcome selection to build a framework for future economic analyses of HCV. A literature search was conducted using SCOPUS, EMBASE, and PubMed from January 1, 2012 to May 28, 2017. Terms sought included a combination of ""incremental cost-effectiveness ratio"" OR ""economic evaluation"" OR ""cost effectiveness analysis"" OR ""cost utility analysis"" OR ""budget impact analysis"" OR ""cost benefit analysis"" AND ""hepatitis C"". A total of 1,040 articles were identified in the search and seven articles were selected for further evaluation after abstracts and the full text of eligible articles were screened. One economic evaluation used direct patient engagement to account for patient preferences in the final model. The study endpoints identified included a variety of clinical, social, psychological, and economic outcomes. Costs primarily focused on productivity loss, missed work, out-of-pocket treatment costs, and indirect costs to family or friends supporting the patient. Conclusion: To date, the inclusion of the patient voice through patient engagement as part of methods in cost-effectiveness research in existing published studies has been limited. Future CEA studies should consider how patient engagement may impact economic models and their implementation into practice. (Hepatology 2018;67:774-781)."
Engaging older people in healthy and active lifestyles: A systematic review	"In 2002, the World Health Organization emphasised the concept of active ageing to manage and increase the last third of life. Although many efforts have been made to optimise treatment management, less attention has been paid to health promotion initiatives. To date, few shared guidelines exist that promote an active life in healthy older targets. To fill this gap, we conducted a systematic review to map health promotion interventions that targeted an active and healthy ageing among older citizens. Articles containing the key term active ageing and seven synonyms were searched for in the electronic databases. Because we were interested in actions aimed to promote healthier lifestyles, we connected the string with the term health. A total of 3,918 titles were retrieved and 20 articles were extracted. Twelve of the 20 studies used group interventions, five interventions targeted the individual level and three interventions targeted the community level. Interventions differed for the health focus of the programmes, which ranged from physical activity interventions to social participation or cognitive functioning. Most of the studies aimed to act on psychological components. The review suggests that different interventions promoted for active ageing are effective in improving specific healthy and active lifestyles; however, no studies were concerned directly with a holistic process of citizen health engagement to improve long-term outcomes.

Engaging Patients as Partners in Developing Patient-Reported Outcome Measures in Cancer-A Review of the Literature	"Purpose: Tools to collect patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are frequently used in the healthcare setting to collect information that is most meaningful to patients. Due to discordance among how patients and healthcare providers rank symptoms that are considered most meaningful to the patient, engagement of patients in the development of PROMs is extremely important. This review aimed to identify studies that described how patients are involved in the item generation stage of cancer-specific PROM tools developed for cancer patients.Methods: A literature search was conducted using keywords relevant to PROMs, cancer, and patient engagement. A manual search of relevant reference lists was also conducted. Inclusion criteria stipulated that publications must describe patient engagement in the item generation stage of development of cancer-specific PROM tools. Results were excluded if they were duplicate findings or non-English.Results: The initial search yielded 230 publications. After removal of duplicates and review of publications, 6 were deemed relevant. Fourteen additional publications were retrieved through a manual search of references from relevant publications. A total of 13 unique PROM tools that included patient input in item generation were identified. The most common method of patient engagement was through qualitative interviews or focus groups.Conclusions: Despite recommendations from international groups and the emphasized importance of incorporating patient feedback in all stages of development of PROMs, few unique tools have incorporated patient input in item generation of cancer-specific tools. Moving forward, a framework of best practices on how to best engage patients in developing PROMs is warranted to support high-quality patient-centered care."
Engaging patients in antimicrobial resistance and stewardship	"Purpose -- The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the perspectives of patient advisors (PAs) on the current state of antimicrobial resistance (AR) and stewardship in Canada and identifies next steps, with the goal of stimulating further collaboration for action between leaders and PAs as well as research. Design/methodology/approach -- The perspectives of PAs were gathered using an electronic online survey of 72 respondents. A search of peer reviewed literature and publicly available reports informed the development of the survey and the articulation of a more comprehensive viewpoint in this paper. Findings -- PAs view AR as a serious and growing public health threat. They believe sharing the responsibility for infection prevention and control and antimicrobial stewardship will help to control the problem. They see healthcare professionals as the most appropriate stakeholders to influence behaviors associated with appropriate antibiotic use, however, they also see value in public campaigns. Importantly, they identify several opportunities for PA contribution: education of care providers, patients, families, and the public; co-design and development of materials, policies, improvement initiatives, and research; and participation in and promotion of public campaigns. Practical implications -- Engaging PAs as partners at all system levels is becoming common practice. PAs bring a unique and complementary perspective that could contribute to antimicrobial stewardship efforts. Originality/value -- This paper begins to bridge a gap between literature and practice, and proposes that PAs can contribute to antimicrobial stewardship efforts."
"Engaging patients in primary care practice transformation: Theory, evidence and practice."	"Patient engagement is a fundamental strategy for achieving patient centred care and is receiving increasing attention in primary care reform efforts such as the patient-centred medical home and related care models. Much of the prior published theory and evidence supporting patient engagement has focused on improving engagement in individual care. Much less is understood about engaging patients as partners in practice improvement at the primary care clinic or practice level. We review the historical and policy context for the growing interest in the USA and UK in patient engagement at the primary care practice level, highlight findings from systematic reviews of the research evidence on practice-level patient engagement and discuss practical considerations for implementing patient engagement. We conclude that while there are persuasive ethical and social justice reasons for empowering patient involvement in practice improvement at the clinic level, research conducted to date in primary care provides suggestive but not yet resounding evidence in support of the instrumental triple aim benefit of practice-level patient engagement. We propose a research agenda to better understand the process and outcomes of practicelevel patient engagement and its potential advantages to both the practice and the patients and communities served. Better evidence as well as resources to support and incentivize effective and feasible engagement methods are needed to catalyse greater diffusion of practice-level patient engagement in primary care practices."
Engaging patients to improve quality of care: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: To identify the strategies and contextual factors that enable optimal engagement of patients in the design, delivery, and evaluation of health services. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane, Scopus, PsychINFO, Social Science Abstracts, EBSCO, and ISI Web of Science from 1990 to 2016 for empirical studies addressing the active participation of patients, caregivers, or families in the design, delivery and evaluation of health services to improve quality of care. Thematic analysis was used to identify (1) strategies and contextual factors that enable optimal engagement of patients, (2) outcomes of patient engagement, and (3) patients' experiences of being engaged. RESULTS: Forty-eight studies were included. Strategies and contextual factors that enable patient engagement were thematically grouped and related to techniques to enhance design, recruitment, involvement and leadership action, and those aimed to creating a receptive context. Reported outcomes ranged from educational or tool development and informed policy or planning documents (discrete products) to enhanced care processes or service delivery and governance (care process or structural outcomes). The level of engagement appears to influence the outcomes of service redesign-discrete products largely derived from low-level engagement (consultative unidirectional feedback)-whereas care process or structural outcomes mainly derived from high-level engagement (co-design or partnership strategies). A minority of studies formally evaluated patients' experiences of the engagement process (n = 12; 25%). While most experiences were positive-increased self-esteem, feeling empowered, or independent-some patients sought greater involvement and felt that their involvement was important but tokenistic, especially when their requests were denied or decisions had already been made. CONCLUSIONS: Patient engagement can inform patient and provider education and policies, as well as enhance service delivery and governance. Additional evidence is needed to understand patients' experiences of the engagement process and whether these outcomes translate into improved quality of care.

"Engaging policy-makers, health system managers, and policy analysts in the knowledge synthesis process: a scoping review."	"BACKGROUND: It is unclear how to engage a wide range of knowledge users in research. We aimed to map the evidence on engaging knowledge users with an emphasis on policy-makers, health system managers, and policy analysts in the knowledge synthesis process through a scoping review. METHODS: We used the Joanna Briggs Institute guidance for scoping reviews. Nine electronic databases (e.g., MEDLINE), two grey literature sources (e.g., OpenSIGLE), and reference lists of relevant systematic reviews were searched from 1996 to August 2016. We included any type of study describing strategies, barriers and facilitators, or assessing the impact of engaging policy-makers, health system managers, and policy analysts in the knowledge synthesis process. Screening and data abstraction were conducted by two reviewers independently with a third reviewer resolving discrepancies. Frequency and thematic analyses were conducted. RESULTS: After screening 8395 titles and abstracts followed by 394 full-texts, 84 unique documents and 7 companion reports fulfilled our eligibility criteria. All 84 documents were published in the last 10 years, and half were prepared in North America. The most common type of knowledge synthesis with knowledge user engagement was a systematic review (36%). The knowledge synthesis most commonly addressed an issue at the level of national healthcare system (48%) and focused on health services delivery (17%) in high-income countries (86%). Policy-makers were the most common (64%) knowledge users, followed by healthcare professionals (49%) and government agencies as well as patients and caregivers (34%). Knowledge users were engaged in conceptualization and design (49%), literature search and data collection (52%), data synthesis and interpretation (71%), and knowledge dissemination and application (44%). Knowledge users were most commonly engaged as key informants through meetings and workshops as well as surveys, focus groups, and interviews either in-person or by telephone and emails. Knowledge user content expertise/awareness was a common facilitator (18%), while lack of time or opportunity to participate was a common barrier (12%). CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge users were most commonly engaged during the data synthesis and interpretation phases of the knowledge synthesis conduct. Researchers should document and evaluate knowledge user engagement in knowledge synthesis. REGISTRATION DETAILS: Open Science Framework ( https://osf.io/4dy53/ )."
Engaging stakeholders in pharmacoepidemiology research: Current state and recommendations.	"Purpose: Given current efforts to enhance patient-centered care and shared decision-making, the International Society of Pharmacoepidemiology Workgroup on Patient Engagement assessed patient and other stakeholder engagement in pharmacoepidemiology research and provides recommendations for the field."
Engaging stakeholders in rehabilitation research: a scoping review of strategies used in partnerships and evaluation of impacts	"PURPOSE: To describe how stakeholder engagement has been undertaken and evaluated in rehabilitation research. METHODS: A scoping review of the scientific literature using five search strategies. Quantitative and qualitative analyses using extracted data. Interpretation of results was iteratively discussed within the team, which included a parent stakeholder. RESULTS: Searches identified 101 candidate papers; 28 were read in full to assess eligibility and 19 were included in the review. People with disabilities and their families were more frequently involved compared to other stakeholders. Stakeholders were often involved in planning and evaluating service delivery. A key issue was identifying stakeholders; strategies used to support their involvement included creating committees, organizing meetings, clarifying roles and offering training. Communication, power sharing and resources influenced how stakeholders could be engaged in the research. Perceived outcomes of stakeholder engagement included the creation of partnerships, facilitating the research process and the application of the results, and empowering stakeholders. Stakeholder engagement outcomes were rarely formally evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: There is a great interest in rehabilitation to engage stakeholders in the research process. However, further evidence is needed to identify effective strategies for meaningful stakeholder engagement that leads to more useful research that positively impacts practice. Implications for Rehabilitation Using several strategies to engage various stakeholders throughout the research process is thought to increase the quality of the research and the rehabilitation process by developing proposals and programs responding better to their needs. Engagement strategies need to be better reported and evaluated in the literature. Engagement facilitate uptake of research findings by increasing stakeholders' awareness of the evidence, the resources available and their own ability to act upon a situation. Factors influencing opportunities for stakeholder engagement need to be better understood."
Engaging stakeholders in the co-development of programs or interventions using Intervention Mapping: A scoping review.	"BACKGROUND: Health care innovations tailored to stakeholder context are more readily adopted. This study aimed to describe how Intervention Mapping (IM) was used to design health care innovations and how stakeholders were involved. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Science Citation Index were searched from 2008 to November 2017. English language studies that used or cited Intervention Mapping were eligible. Screening and data extraction were done in triplicate. Summary statistics were used to describe study characteristics, IM steps employed, and stakeholder involvement. RESULTS: A total of 852 studies were identified, 449 were unique, and 333 were excluded based on title and abstracts, 116 full-text articles were considered and 61 articles representing 60 studies from 13 countries for a variety of clinical issues were included. The number of studies published per year increased since 2008 and doubled in 2016 and 2017. The majority of studies employed multiple research methods (76.7%) and all 6 IM steps (73.3%). Resulting programs/interventions were single (55.4%) or multifaceted (46.4%), and 60.7% were pilot-tested. Programs or interventions were largely educational material or meetings, and were targeted to patients (70.2%), clinicians (14.0%) or both (15.8%). Studies provided few details about current or planned evaluation. Of the 4 (9.3%) studies that reported impact or outcomes, 3 achieved positive improvements in patient or professional behaviour or patient outcomes. Many studies (28.3%) did not involve stakeholders. Those that did (71.7%) often involved a combination of patients, clinicians, and community organizations. However, less than half (48.8%) described how they were engaged. Most often stakeholders were committee members and provide feedback on program or intervention content or format. CONCLUSIONS: It is unclear if use of IM or stakeholder engagement in IM consistently results in effective programs or interventions. Those employing IM should report how stakeholders were involved in each IM step and how involvement influenced program or intervention design. They should also report the details or absence of planned evaluation. Future research should investigate how to optimize stakeholder engagement in IM, and whether use of IM itself or stakeholder engagement in IM are positively associated with effective programs or interventions."
Evaluating Patient Empowerment in Association With eHealth Technology: Scoping Review	"BACKGROUND: The prioritization of sustainable patient-centered care in contemporary health care has resulted in an increased focus on patient empowerment, which in turn is considered to facilitate patient independence, self-management, and self-efficacy. However, a definitional consensus of empowerment remains elusive, impeding efforts to translate the conceptual ideals of empowerment into a measurable entity associated with changes in health care behavior or outcomes. The rapid integration of technology in health care serves to add another layer of complexity in the measurability and operationalization of empowerment and helps to create a specific context in which this conceptual entity should be further examined. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this scoping review was to explore the concept of patient empowerment within the electronic health (eHealth) context. A further focus on the association or measurement of this concept in conjunction with tethered patient portal use was also employed. METHODS: In this scoping review, a six-step framework was used to guide the search and paper selection process. The review was initiated with two broad research questions, which are as follows: (1) What is the relationship between empowerment and the use of eHealth technologies from a patient perspective? (2) How is patient empowerment (and/or engagement or activation) influenced by accessing personal health information through a tethered patient portal? Multiple databases were employed in a comprehensive search strategy, and papers were primarily evaluated and selected for inclusion by 2 review authors, and a third author was consulted to resolve any issues in reaching consensus. RESULTS: From an initial count of 1387 publications, this review returned nine systematic or literature review papers and 19 empirical studies that pertained to patient empowerment (and/or engagement and activation) in relation to the use of tethered patient portals providing access to electronic health records (EHRs). Of the 19 empirical publications, only four were found to have used specific patient empowerment measures with significant variety in their identified conceptual elements. CONCLUSIONS: There is a persistent lack of conceptual clarity in patient empowerment research, and this has extended to study within the eHealth context. The interchangeable use or conflation of terms such as patient empowerment, engagement, and activation, has further complicated the advancement of distinct conceptual measures. To more strongly align changes in patient empowerment with supportive eHealth solutions, the challenges of achieving a consensus on how best to operationalize and measure patient empowerment must be met.

Evaluation of patient involvement in a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data in cervical cancer treatment.	"BACKGROUND: In April 2005, researchers based at the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, set out to involve women affected by cervical cancer in a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data to evaluate treatments for this disease. Each of the women had previously been treated for cervical cancer. Following completion of the meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the process of involvement from the researcher and research partner perspective. METHODS: An advisory group was first established to give advice on recruiting, supporting and involving women and led to efforts to recruit women to take part in the systematic review using different approaches. Evaluation of the process and outcomes of the partnership between the systematic reviewers and the patients, in respect to what the partnership achieved; what worked well and what were the difficulties; what was learned and the resource requirements, took place during the conduct of the meta-analysis and again after completion of the project. RESULTS: Six women, each of whom had received treatments for cervical cancer, were recruited as Patient Research Partners and five of these women subsequently took part in a variety of activities around the systematic review. They attended progress meetings and all but one attended a meeting at which the first results of the review were presented to all collaborators and gave feedback. Three of the women also became involved in a further related research project which led to an editorial publication from the patient perspective and also participated, along with two lead researchers, in the evaluation of the process and outcomes. While they were generally positive about the experience, one Patient Research Partner questioned the extent of the impact patients could make to the systematic review process. CONCLUSIONS: In general, researchers and patient research partners felt that they had learned a lot from the process and considered it to have been a positive experience. The researchers felt that because of resource implications, patient involvement in future systematic reviews would probably have to be prioritized to those in which the greatest impacts could be achieved."
Examining the evidence of the impact of health information technology in primary care: An argument for participatory research with health professionals and patients.	"Purpose: Health information technology represents a promising avenue to improve health care delivery. How can we use lessons learnt from existing health information technologies in primary care to inform the optimal design of newer developments such as personal health records? Methods: The results of systematic literature reviews about the impact of different information systems on health outcomes in primary care are critically discussed in a narrative synthesis, with a focus on their implications for the development of personal health records. Results: Given the proliferation of systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials, high quality evidence for health information technology in primary care is accumulating with mixed results. The heterogeneity of systems being compared and the quality of research can no longer account for these findings. One potential explanation may be that systems originally designed for acute care settings are being implemented in primary care. Early studies evaluating personal health records suggest that targeting patient outcomes directly and adapting systems to patients' needs may be part of the solution. Conclusion: In order to develop personal health records for primary care, studies are needed that involve the users, namely patients and primary care health professionals, in the design and evaluation of these systems from their inception. Participatory research is a recommended methodological approach. ¬© 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."
Exploring patient and family involvement in the lifecycle of an orphan drug: a scoping review	"BACKGROUND: Patients and their families have become more active in healthcare systems and research. The value of patient involvement is particularly relevant in the area of rare diseases, where patients face delayed diagnoses and limited access to effective therapies due to the high level of uncertainty in market approval and reimbursement decisions. It has been suggested that patient involvement may help to reduce some of these uncertainties. This review explored existing and proposed roles for patients, families, and patient organizations at each stage of the lifecycle of therapies for rare diseases (i.e., orphan drug lifecycle). METHODS: A scoping review was conducted using methods outlined by Arksey and O'Malley. To validate the findings from the literature and identify any additional opportunities that were missed, a consultative webinar was conducted with members of the Patient and Caregiver Liaison Group of a Canadian research network. RESULTS: Existing and proposed opportunities for involving patients, families, and patient organizations were reported throughout the orphan drug lifecycle and fell into 12 themes: research outside of clinical trials; clinical trials; patient reported outcomes measures; patient registries and biorepositories; education; advocacy and awareness; conferences and workshops; patient care and support; patient organization development; regulatory decision-making; and reimbursement decision-making. Existing opportunities were not described in sufficient detail to allow for the level of involvement to be assessed. Additionally, no information on the impact of involvement within specific opportunities was found. Based on feedback from patients and families, documentation of existing opportunities within Canada is poor. CONCLUSIONS: Opportunities for patient, family, and patient organization involvement exist throughout the orphan drug lifecycle. However, based on the information found, it is not possible to determine which opportunities would be most effective at each stage."
Exploring patient engagement practices and resources within a health care system: Applying a multi-phased mixed methods knowledge mobilization approach	"A Canadian health authority developed a patient engagement framework, but had no standard resources or supports to prepare staff, leaders or patients/families for meaningful patient engagement. A study was conducted to determine what resources, preparation and supports were needed for patients, providers and leaders to be meaningfully engaged in patient-centred care decisions, and for the contents of a resource 'kit.' A multi-phased mixed methods approach included a needs assessment with patients, providers and leaders on what was essential for the patient engagement experience; a scoping literature review on appropriate resources; a patient engagement 'Resource Kit' based on findings; and a pilot and evaluation of the kit. This integrated approach resulted in a resource kit that was relevant in terms of content, comprehensive in the volume of resources, and tailored to the unique needs of patients/families, providers and leaders. Continuing evolution and evaluation of the kit was seen as critical."
Exploring the Needs and Lived Experiences of Racial and Ethnic Minority Domestic Violence Survivors Through Community-Based Participatory Research: A Systematic Review.	"Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is a methodological approach where community-academic teams build equitable relationships throughout the research process. In the domestic violence (DV) field, CBPR may be particularly important when conducting research with racial and ethnic minority DV survivors, as this group faces concurrent oppressions that inform their lived experiences. To our knowledge, no systematic review has synthesized articles using a CBPR approach to explore the needs and lived experiences of racial and ethnic minority DV survivors. Using PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of the literature, retrieving articles that used a CBPR approach to understand the needs and/or lived experiences of female racial and ethnic minority DV survivors residing in the United States. Articles were identified from peer-reviewed databases, bibliographies, and experts. Thirteen of the 185 articles assessed for eligibility were included. Articles focused on a variety of racial and ethnic minority groups, the majority identifying as African American or Latina. Collaboration occurred in multiple ways, primarily through equitable decision-making and building team members' strengths. Several needs and lived experiences emerged including gender identity and patriarchal attitudes, racism and discrimination, the immigrant experience informing DV, poverty, shame and stigma, and the need for social support. This is the first systematic review of articles using a CBPR approach to explore the needs and lived experiences of racial and ethnic minority survivors. Implications include promoting community-based dissemination, conducting quantitative studies with larger sample sizes of DV survivors, and encouraging culturally specific services that address DV survivors' intersectional needs."
"Extent, quality and impact of patient and public involvement in antimicrobial drug development research: A systematic review."	"BACKGROUND: Patient and public involvement (PPI) is increasingly recognized as bringing a range of benefits to clinical and health services research. Recent systematic reviews have identified and synthesized many benefits (eg higher recruitment rates) and some costs (eg extra time need). Much of the literature focuses on PPI in long-term conditions rather than more acute health care in which the majority of microbiological research is undertaken. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to identify the extent, quality and impact of PPI in antimicrobial drug development research. Objectives were to identify any relevant reporting of PPI in antimicrobial research; appraise the quality of reporting on PPI using recognized PPI reporting and critical appraisal tools; and extract and synthesize data on the impact of PPI. SEARCH STRATEGY: A systematic review was undertaken with a search strategy based on four word groups (PPI, patients, antimicrobial drug development and outcomes). Eight online databases were searched. INCLUSION CRITERIA: English language publication, publication between 1996 and 2016 and studies describing PPI in antimicrobial drug development research. MAIN RESULTS: No studies were found through online searching that met the search strategy and inclusion criteria. One relevant protocol paper with a brief mention of PPI was identified through expert recommendation. Commentary papers recommending PPI were identified through website searching and expert opinion. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Despite strong policy guidance encouraging PPI at the international and national levels, and anecdotal accounts of PPI taking place, evidence for the extent, quality and impact of PPI in antimicrobial drug development research has not yet appeared in the peer-reviewed literature.

Facilitating Web-Based Collaboration in Evidence Synthesis (TaskExchange): Development and Analysis.	"BACKGROUND: The conduct and publication of scientific research are increasingly open and collaborative. There is growing interest in Web-based platforms that can effectively enable global, multidisciplinary scientific teams and foster networks of scientists in areas of shared research interest. Designed to facilitate Web-based collaboration in research evidence synthesis, TaskExchange highlights the potential of these kinds of platforms. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the development, growth, and future of TaskExchange, a Web-based platform facilitating collaboration in research evidence synthesis. METHODS: The original purpose of TaskExchange was to create a platform that connected people who needed help with their Cochrane systematic reviews (rigorous syntheses of health research) with people who had the time and expertise to help. The scope of TaskExchange has now been expanded to include other evidence synthesis tasks, including guideline development. The development of TaskExchange was initially undertaken in 5 agile development phases with substantial user engagement. In each phase, software was iteratively deployed as it was developed and tested, enabling close cycles of development and refinement. RESULTS: TaskExchange enables users to browse and search tasks and members by keyword or nested filters, post and respond to tasks, sign up to notification emails, and acknowledge the work of TaskExchange members. The pilot platform has been open access since August 2016, has over 2300 members, and has hosted more than 630 tasks, covering a wide range of research synthesis-related tasks. Response rates are consistently over 75%, and user feedback has been positive. CONCLUSIONS: TaskExchange demonstrates the potential for new technologies to support Web-based collaboration in health research. Development of a relatively simple platform for peer-to-peer exchange has provided opportunities for systematic reviewers to get their reviews completed more quickly and provides an effective pathway for people to join the global health evidence community.

Facilitators and barriers to pregnant women's participation in research: A systematic review.	"Background: Although there is consensus among many that exclusion of pregnant women from clinical research should be justified, there is uncertainty as to whether and why pregnant women themselves would be willing to participate even if they were found to be eligible. The objective was to identify the reasons why pregnant women participate in clinical research and thereby to distinguish between facilitators and barriers."
Framework for Advancing the Reporting of Patient Engagement in Rheumatology Research Projects.	"Purpose of Review: The term ""patient engagement in research"" refers to patients and their surrogates undertaking roles in the research process beyond those of study participants. This paper proposes a new framework for describing patient engagement in research, based on analysis of 30 publications related to patient engagement. Recent Findings: Over the past 15 years, patients' perspectives have been instrumental in broadening the scope of rheumatology research and outcome measurement, such as evaluating fatigue in rheumatoid arthritis. Recent reviews, however, highlight low-quality reporting of patient engagement in research. Until we have more detailed information about patient engagement in rheumatology research, our understanding of how patients' perspectives are being integrated into research projects remains limited. Summary: When authors follow our guidance on the important components for describing patients' roles and function as ""research partners,"" researchers and other knowledge users will better understand how patients' perspectives were integrated in their research projects."
Frameworks for supporting patient and public involvement in research: Systematic review and co-design pilot.	"BACKGROUND: Numerous frameworks for supporting, evaluating and reporting patient and public involvement in research exist. The literature is diverse and theoretically heterogeneous. OBJECTIVES: To identify and synthesize published frameworks, consider whether and how these have been used, and apply design principles to improve usability. SEARCH STRATEGY: Keyword search of six databases; hand search of eight journals; ancestry and snowball search; requests to experts. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Published, systematic approaches (frameworks) designed to support, evaluate or report on patient or public involvement in health-related research. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted on provenance; collaborators and sponsors; theoretical basis; lay input; intended user(s) and use(s); topics covered; examples of use; critiques; and updates. We used the Canadian Centre for Excellence on Partnerships with Patients and Public (CEPPP) evaluation tool and hermeneutic methodology to grade and synthesize the frameworks. In five co-design workshops, we tested evidence-based resources based on the review findings. RESULTS: Our final data set consisted of 65 frameworks, most of which scored highly on the CEPPP tool. They had different provenances, intended purposes, strengths and limitations. We grouped them into five categories: power-focused; priority-setting; study-focused; report-focused; and partnership-focused. Frameworks were used mainly by the groups who developed them. The empirical component of our study generated a structured format and evidence-based facilitator notes for a ""build your own framework"" co-design workshop. CONCLUSION: The plethora of frameworks combined with evidence of limited transferability suggests that a single, off-the-shelf framework may be less useful than a menu of evidence-based resources which stakeholders can use to co-design their own frameworks.

Health and Wellbeing Boards: a new dawn for public health partnerships?	"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to consider the effectiveness of partnership working in public health and draws on a systematic review of public health partnerships and original research conducted by the authors. It then considers in the light of research evidence whether the recently established Health and Wellbeing Boards (HWBs) under the 2012 Health and Social Care Act will help agencies to work together more effectively to improve population health or will go the way of previous initiatives and fall short of their original promise. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a systematic literature review conducted by the authors and empirical research focusing upon the ability of public health partnerships to reduce health inequalities and improve population health outcomes. It also draws on recent studies evaluating HWBs. Findings: The paper finds that, hitherto, public health partnerships have had limited impact on improving population health and reducing health inequalities and that there is a danger that HWBs will follow the same path-dependent manner of previous partnership initiatives with limited impact in improving population health outcomes and reducing health inequalities. Research limitations/implications: The research draws on a systematic literature review and further scoping review of public health partnerships, in addition to empirical research conducted by the authors. It also reviews the current evidence base on HWBs. It is recognised that HWBs are still in their early stages and may not as yet, had the time to fulfil their role in service collaboration and integration. Practical implications: The paper gives an overview of how and why public health partnerships in the past have not lived up to the expectations placed upon them. It then offers practical steps that HWBs need to take to take to ensure the mistakes of the past are not replicated in the future. Social implications: The research outlines how public health partnerships can operate in a more effective manner, to ensure a more seamless provision for service users. The paper then gives pointers as to how this can benefit HWBs and the wider community they serve. Originality/value: The paper draws on a comprehensive research study of the effectiveness of public health partnerships on improving health outcomes and a systematic literature review. In addition, it also draws upon the current evidence base evaluating HWBs, to inform the discussion on their future prospects, in regard to partnership working in public health and promoting service integration.; Politicians in Ireland aim to radically transform access to healthcare by changing the current two-tiered system to a single-tier, universal healthcare service ensuring access to healthcare on the basis of medical need; not ability to pay. Successful implementation of this vision requires enabling a health system with the capacity to deliver in fact. Bedevilled with long waiting lists, emergency department bottlenecks, path dependent fragmentation and chronic under-resourcing of the primary and community care domains (to name a few of the challenges apparent), the Irish health system needs to forge practical paths to a level of integration greater than (although encompassing) the integrated care programmes already in train. This paper, based on initial findings of a systematic review of the 'organisational challenges of implementing universal healthcare policies in countries with a GDP per capita greater than $22,000' is oriented towards policy-makers, health system designers, enablers and providers - particularly those working in a context where health reform is focussed on implementing universal and integrated care models. Our initial search identified 1,784 papers (having removed duplicates) and after 5 screening stages resulted in 9 papers for review. These include a range of study types, and report findings from the USA, Australia, Canada, UK, Italy and Taiwan. Findings highlight the variety of policy instruments used to deliver universal healthcare, these include legislation, social health insurance and Medicare subsidies at the policy level; they also note service implementation processes, design, performance evaluation and leadership programmes aimed at greater system cohesion and integration at the practice level. The challenges and opportunities identified from our analysis relate primarily to provider practice and collaboration - both themes central to the development of integrated care. We find that providers experience better continuity of care and hence job satisfaction in some universal access settings, but also come up against systemic barriers to the shared decisionmaking, information flows and new role requirements necessary for integrated and universal access to care. The difficulty of changing role definitions and expectations is also apparent in our theme of collaboration. Getting stakeholders to engage in transparent peer-review, shifting fixed mind-sets and behaviours, optimum pacing of policy implementation for engagement, and systemic constraints that disable the renegotiation of professional differences on teams (for example) are also identified as important challenges. These findings can inform politicians and policy-makers as they express a vision and plan for the 'Future of Healthcare in Ireland' over the next 10 years (http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/oireachtasbusiness/committees_list/future-ofhealthcare/). More broadly they offer pertinent evidence for those eager to better understand the processes of health system transition and transformation through a practical lens. We conclude on the basis of our review that universal healthcare implies a health system designed for integrated care. Making the explicit link between universal healthcare and integrated care on the basis of the organisational challenges and opportunities inherent to both policy directions is innovative and useful for health system reformers generally."
How and why should we engage parents as co-researchers in health research? A scoping review of current practices	"BACKGROUND: The importance of engaging parents in health research as co-researchers is gaining growing recognition. While a number of benefits of involving parents as co-researchers have been proposed, guidelines on exactly how effective engagement can be achieved are lacking. The objectives of this scoping review were to (i) synthesize current evidence on engaging parents as co-researchers in health research; (ii) identify the potential benefits and challenges of engaging parent co-researchers; and (iii) identify gaps in the literature. METHODS: A scoping literature review was conducted using established methodology. Four research databases and one large grey literature database were searched, in addition to hand-searching relevant journals. Articles meeting specific inclusion criteria were retrieved and data extracted. Common characteristics were identified and summarized. RESULTS: Ten articles were included in the review, assessed as having low-to-moderate quality. Parent co-researchers were engaged in the planning, design, data collection, analysis and dissemination aspects of research. Structural enablers included reimbursement and childcare. Benefits of engaging parent co-researchers included enhancing the relevance of research to the target population, maximizing research participation and parent empowerment. Challenges included resource usage, wide-ranging experiences, lack of role clarity and power differences between parent co-researchers and researchers. Evaluation of parent co-researcher engagement was heterogeneous and lacked rigour. CONCLUSIONS: A robust evidence base is currently lacking in how to effectively engage parent co-researchers. However, the review offers some insights into specific components that may form the basis of future research to inform the development of best practice guidelines. Copyright ¬© 2016 The Authors.

How are decisions on care services for people with dementia made and experienced? A systematic review and qualitative synthesis of recent empirical findings	"Background: During recent decades, there has been a growing recognition that people cannot be assumed incapable of making decisions about their own care solely on the basis of a dementia diagnosis and international agreements and legislative changes have strengthened the formal right for people with dementia to participate in decisions on care services. This raises important questions about how these decisions are currently made and experienced in practice. In this review, we address this question and highlight directions for further research. Methods: We searched CINAHL, PsycINFO, ASSIA, Social Services Abstracts, Science Direct, Academic Search Premier, and PubMed. Twenty-four pertinent articles were identified, all representing qualitative studies. Relevant findings were extracted and synthesized along dimensions of involvement of the person with dementia in decisions on care services, using an integrative approach to qualitative synthesis. Results: We identified three overarching ways in which people with dementia are involved, primarily, in the informal part of a process of decisions: excluded, prior preferences taken into account, and current preferences respected. Several (10) articles seemed to be based on the assumption that decisions on care services are invariably and solely made within the family and without participation of the person with dementia. Conclusions: The review emphasizes the need for more updated research about international debates and agreements concerning capabilities and rights of people with dementia and about the (potential) formal contexts of care decisions in the country concerned. This, we argue, is vital for future knowledge production in the area. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
How embedded is public involvement in mainstream health research in England a decade after policy implementation? A realist evaluation.	Objectives To explore how embedded patient and public involvement is within mainstream health research following two decades of policy-driven work to underpin health research with patient and public involvement in England.
How is patient involvement measured in patient centeredness scales for health professionals? A systematic review of their measurement properties and content.	"BACKGROUND: Patient centeredness is an important component of patient care and healthcare quality. Several scales exist to measure patient centeredness, and previous literature provides a critical appraisal of their measurement properties. However, limited knowledge exists regarding the content of the various scales in terms of what type of patient centeredness they represent and how they can be used for quality improvement. The aim of this study was to explore the measurement properties of patient centeredness scales and their content with a special focus on patient involvement, and assess whether and how they can be used for quality improvement. METHODS: A systematic review of patient centeredness scales was conducted in Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and SCOPUS in April and May 2017. Inclusion criteria were limited to articles written in English published from 2005 to 2017. Eligible studies were critically appraised in terms of internal consistency and reliability, as well as their content, structural, and cross-cultural validity. Type of studies included were scale-development articles and validation studies of relevant scales, with healthcare personnel as respondents. We used directed content analysis to categorize the scales and items according to Tritter's conceptual framework for patient and public involvement. RESULTS: Eleven scales reported in 22 articles were included. Most scales represented individual, indirect, and reactive patient involvement. Most scales included items that did not reflect patient centeredness directly, but rather organizational preconditions for patient centered practices. None of the scales included items explicitly reflecting the use of patient experiences of quality improvement. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of patient centeredness scales focusing on direct and proactive involvement of patients in quality improvement. It would be useful to develop such instruments to further study the role of patient involvement in quality improvement in healthcare. Furthermore, they could be used as important tools in quality improvement interventions."
How might patient involvement in healthcare quality improvement efforts work-A realist literature review.	"INTRODUCTION: This realist literature review, regarding active patient involvement in healthcare quality improvement (QI), seeks to identify possible mechanisms that contribute to success or failure. Furthermore, the paper outlines key considerations for organizing and supporting patient involvement in healthcare QI efforts."
How stakeholder participation can contribute to systematic reviews of complex interventions	"Although patient and public involvement in research is a requirement for research funding in many countries, the knowledge base for how to effectively involve people-and evidence of the effectiveness of involvement-is weak. This article describes how methods used in participatory health research were used to involve patients, clients, providers and community health workers across all stages of a realist review. Sustained involvement enabled better identification of the components of the complex intervention of community-based peer support. It also challenged assumptions of how peer support is constructed, leading the review team to question whether the process of designing and implementing interventions has more influence on effectiveness than previously recognised in empirical studies. We conclude with a discussion on when sustained involvement should be used, and the challenges of incorporating it into the traditional researcher-led approach to systematic reviews.

How to empower patients? A systematic review and meta-analysis.	"Patient empowerment, a concept focused on patient-centeredness and patients autonomy, is a well-discussed topic in health literature. However, translating theory into practice is a challenge. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of interventions on patient empowerment and to identify and compare the modalities of these interventions. For this systematic review including meta-analysis, eligibility criteria were as follows: (i) adult participants with one or more chronic somatic diseases, (ii) ""patient empowerment"" was explicitly measured (i.e., outcome or measuring instrument), (iii) randomized controlled designs, and (iv) written in English, French, Dutch, or German. A systematic search strategy was applied in five online databases (last search: March 29, 2017). Thirty-two studies were included in this review, of which 23 studies could be included in the meta-analysis. Overall effect estimate was significant in favor of the intervention; however, heterogeneity was high. Subgroup analyses revealed that the effect estimate was higher in studies with interventions that comprised individual sessions. The most recurrent behavioral change technique identified in our review was ""knowledge"", though this is not sufficient to empower. ""Goal setting"" and ""action planning"" were more likely to be applied in successful interventions. ""Knowledge"" could be combined with ""goal setting"" and ""action planning"" to empower. Thorough understanding of the concept of patient empowerment remains necessary. Future research should focus on somatic chronic diseases other than diabetes, a consensus definition for patient empowerment, and clinimetric properties of instruments."
Identifying Barriers to Hospitalized Patients' Participation in a Free Smoking Cessation Support Program	"Introduction For many smokers, hospitalization leads to a teachable moment regarding smoking cessation. Purpose To survey hospitalized patients who smoke and determine their perceived barriers to quitting and participating in a free cessation support program post-discharge. Method This study employed a cross-sectional, descriptive design. Development of the 27-item tool was based on previous cessation surveys and stakeholder interviews. Convenience sampling identified 79 current smokers in acute care medical-surgical units at a community-based hospital. Findings The majority of subjects reported they wanted to quit smoking, with approximately half unsuccessfully attempting to quit within the past year. A strong correlation was found between readiness to quit and motivation to quit. Subjects' greatest fears about quitting included becoming tense/nervous, mood swings, fear of failure, and weight gain. Almost 50% of subjects had partners who smoked. The majority of subjects stated they would be willing to speak with a registered nurse after discharge; however, only 40% were willing to attend a free smoking cessation pro- gram. Conclusion A smoking cessation program must be structured to include the patient, spouse, family, and friends to increase support. Through interventions, such as education, nicotine replacement therapy, and counseling, the goal is to decrease the anxiety level and increase the motivation to participate in a smoking cessation program in the hospital setting."
"Identifying the most important outcomes for systematic reviews of interventions for rhinosinusitis in adults: working with Patients, Public and Practitioners."	"INTRODUCTION: Promoting the assessment of health interventions using outcomes that matter to patients and practitioners is a key principle of Cochrane. Cochrane UK therefore commissioned the OMIPP project: Outcomes that are Most Important for Patients, Public and Practitioners to identify the outcomes they felt most important and should be evaluated in Cochrane reviews of health interventions for Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS). METHODOLOGY: Using direct emailing, social media and printed cards, an online survey was distributed to a wide range of people involved in the care of patients with CRS. Patients and practitioners were asked to list the 3 outcomes from treatments most important to them. Responses were analysed through development of a thematic framework based on the data. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-five people completed the survey; 155 practitioners and 80 patients. Respondents provided 653 suggestions of important outcomes. 73% concerned symptoms of CRS, (nasal discharge or drip, facial pain, nasal blockage, headache, impaired sense of smell, congestion and breathing difficulties); 9% concerned quality of life, 4% reducing the need for further treatment and 4% side effects of treatment. Objective measurements of disease formed only 3% of responses. There was high level of agreement between patients and practitioners. Of 10 current Cochrane reviews on CRS, 9 include symptomatic outcomes identified by our survey as most important to patients and healthcare practitioners. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified outcomes that both patients and their doctors consider should be included in reviews evaluating treatments of rhinosinusitis. We recommend that primary outcomes in future reviews focus on symptom-based outcomes. The ability to extract these data from relevant trials is dependent upon their inclusion in trials, and so it is important that building on this work a core outcome set for rhinosinusitis research is developed."
Impact of patient and public involvement on enrolment and retention in clinical trials: systematic review and meta-analysis	"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of patient and public involvement (PPI) on rates of enrolment and retention in clinical trials and explore how this varies with the context and nature of PPI. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Ten electronic databases, including Medline, INVOLVE Evidence Library, and clinical trial registries. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Experimental and observational studies quantitatively evaluating the impact of a PPI intervention, compared with no intervention or non-PPI intervention(s), on participant enrolment and/or retention rates in a clinical trial or trials. PPI interventions could include additional non-PPI components inseparable from the PPI (for example, other stakeholder involvement). DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent reviewers extracted data on enrolment and retention rates, as well as on the context and characteristics of PPI intervention, and assessed risk of bias. Random effects meta-analyses were used to determine the average effect of PPI interventions on enrolment and retention in clinical trials: main analysis including randomised studies only, secondary analysis adding non-randomised studies, and several exploratory subgroup and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: 26 studies were included in the review; 19 were eligible for enrolment meta-analysis and five for retention meta-analysis. Various PPI interventions were identified with different degrees of involvement, different numbers and types of people involved, and input at different stages of the trial process. On average, PPI interventions modestly but significantly increased the odds of participant enrolment in the main analysis (odds ratio 1.16, 95% confidence interval and prediction interval 1.01 to 1.34). Non-PPI components of interventions may have contributed to this effect. In exploratory subgroup analyses, the involvement of people with lived experience of the condition under study was significantly associated with improved enrolment (odds ratio 3.14 v 1.07; P=0.02). The findings for retention were inconclusive owing to the paucity of eligible studies (odds ratio 1.16, 95% confidence interval 0.33 to 4.14), for main analysis). CONCLUSIONS: These findings add weight to the case for PPI in clinical trials by indicating that it is likely to improve enrolment of participants, especially if it includes people with lived experience of the health condition under study. Further research is needed to assess which types of PPI work best in particular contexts, the cost effectiveness of PPI, the impact of PPI at earlier stages of trial design, and the impact of PPI interventions specifically targeting retention.

Impacts of older people's patient and public involvement in health and social care research: a systematic review.	"Background: patient and public involvement (PPI) in research has been linked with numerous beneficial impacts, however, evidence for older people's involvement is limited. Objectives: to evaluate the impacts of involving older people in health and social care research on older co-researchers, academic researchers, and research processes and outcomes. A secondary aim was to explore critical success factors and future considerations for PPI. Design: systematic review. Methods: six databases were searched for English language articles published between 2006 and 2017. A supplementary search was conducted. Two authors independently retrieved articles using standardised inclusion criteria and data extraction forms. Articles reporting formal evaluation of older people's involvement were included. Results: nine articles, all using qualitative methodology, were included. Benefits for older co-researchers included psychological and social benefits, new learning, and activism and career opportunities, while challenging impacts comprised demanding workloads, difficult relationships and dissatisfaction with level of involvement. Benefits for academic researchers entailed new learning and shared workloads; challenges related to demanding workloads and difficult relationships. Both positive and negative effects on research quality and impact were observed. Benefits for participants and the community were demonstrated. Building relationships, facilitating communication and breaking down barriers to participation were identified as critical success factors. Conclusions: evidence for the impacts of older people's involvement is mixed although benefits appear to outweigh the challenges. Future considerations for PPI include matching older people's skills and motivations to the project and level of involvement, and establishing an iterative research process in which evaluation is embedded."
Incorporating patients' views in guideline development: a systematic review of guidance documents	"OBJECTIVES: To assess how guidance documents for developing clinical guidelines (CGs) address the incorporation of patients' views in CGs. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Systematic review to identify the methodology provided in guidance documents for incorporating (1) patients or representatives and (2) patients' views in the CG development process. The search was performed in 2017 in five databases. Two authors selected the studies, and data extraction was double-checked. RESULTS: We included guidance documents from 56 institutions. Of those, 40 (71.4%) recommended the inclusion of patients or their representatives, mainly for developing recommendations (14/40, 35.0%); reviewing the final version (13/40, 32.5%); formulating clinical questions (13/40, 32.5%); defining the scope and objectives (10/40, 25.0%); and dissemination and implementation (10/40, 25.0%). Concrete methods on how to incorporate patients were provided by 47.5% (19/40) of institutions. Forty (71.4%) institutions provided additional strategies to incorporate patients' views. The majority (30/40, 75.0%) suggested sources for obtaining these views (consultation with patients 24/40, 60.0%], using panels' judgment 10/40, 25.0%], conducting de novo research 10/40, 25.0%], or a systematic review 9/40, 22.5%]). CONCLUSION: Although most institutions suggest incorporating patients and their views when developing CGs, little detail is provided on how to do this. Institutions should provide more guidance as this could have a positive impact in guideline applicability. Copyright ¬© 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Involving disabled children and young people as partners in research: a systematic review	"Children and young people can be valuable partners in research, giving their unique perspectives on what and how research should be done. However, disabled children are less commonly involved in research than their non-disabled peers. This review investigated how disabled children have been involved as research partners; specifically how they have been recruited, the practicalities and challenges of involvement and how these have been overcome, and impacts of involvement for research, and disabled children and young people. The INVOLVE definition of involvement and the Equality and Human Rights Commission definition of disability were used. Relevant bibliographic databases were searched. Websites were searched for grey literature. Included studies had involved disabled children and young people aged 5-25 years in any study design. Reviews, guidelines, reports and other documents from the grey literature were eligible for inclusion. Twenty-two papers were included: seven reviews, eight original research papers, three reports, three guidelines and one webpage. Nine examples of involvement were identified. Recommendations included developing effective communication techniques, using flexible methods that can be adapted to needs and preferences, and ensuring that sufficient support and funding is available for researchers undertaking involvement. Positive impacts of involvement for disabled children included increased confidence, self-esteem and independence. Positive impacts for research were identified. Involving disabled children in research can present challenges; many of these can be overcome with sufficient time, planning and resources. More needs to be done to find ways to involve those with non-verbal communication. Generally, few details were reported about disabled children and young people's involvement in studies, and the quality of evidence was low. Although a range of positive impacts were identified, the majority of these were authors' opinions rather than data. There remains scope for methodological research to inform appropriate approaches to public and patient involvement in childhood disability research. Copyright ¬© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
Involving the public in systematic reviews: a narrative review of organizational approaches and eight case examples	"This paper reviews the recent literature on public involvement in the systematic review process. We examine how relevant organizations involve the public in their review processes and how the public are involved in individual reviews. We identified nine surveys or reports of public involvement in systematic reviews at an organizational level and eight examples of public involvement in individual reviews. The public was found to be involved in the following stages of the review process: topic prioritization; refining the scope of the review; suggesting, locating and appraising the literature; interpreting findings; and writing up the review. Numerous tensions, facilitating strategies and recommendations for good practice were identified. Future research directions are delineated."
Lay and professional stakeholder involvement in scoping palliative care issues: Methods used in seven European countries.	"BACKGROUND: Stakeholders are people with an interest in a topic. Internationally, stakeholder involvement in palliative care research and health technology assessment requires development. Stakeholder involvement adds value throughout research (from prioritising topics to disseminating findings). Philosophies and understandings about the best ways to involve stakeholders in research differ internationally. Stakeholder involvement took place in seven countries (England, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway and Poland). Findings informed a project that developed concepts and methods for health technology assessment and applied these to evaluate models of palliative care service delivery. AIMS: To report on stakeholder involvement in the INTEGRATE-HTA project and how issues identified informed project development. DESIGN: Using stakeholder consultation or a qualitative research design, as appropriate locally, stakeholders in seven countries acted as 'advisors' to aid researchers' decision making. Thematic analysis was used to identify key issues across countries. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 132 stakeholders (82 professionals and 50 'lay' people) aged 18 participated in individual face-to-face or telephone interviews, consultation meetings or focus groups. RESULTS: Different stakeholder involvement methods were used successfully to identify key issues in palliative care. A total of 23 issues common to three or more countries informed decisions about the intervention and comparator of interest, sub questions and specific assessments within the health technology assessment. CONCLUSION: Stakeholders, including patients and families undergoing palliative care, can inform project decision making using various involvement methods according to the local context. Researchers should consider local understandings about stakeholder involvement as views of appropriate and feasible methods vary. Methods for stakeholder involvement, especially consultation, need further development."
Lay perspectives on hypertension and drug adherence: systematic review of qualitative research	"OBJECTIVE: To synthesise the findings from individual qualitative studies on patients' understanding and experiences of hypertension and drug taking; to investigate whether views differ internationally by culture or ethnic group and whether the research could inform interventions to improve adherence. DESIGN: Systematic review and narrative synthesis of qualitative research using the 2006 UK Economic and Social Research Council research methods programme guidance. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, the British Nursing Index, Social Policy and Practice, and PsycInfo from inception to October 2011. STUDY SELECTION: Qualitative interviews or focus groups among people with uncomplicated hypertension (studies principally in people with diabetes, established cardiovascular disease, or pregnancy related hypertension were excluded). RESULTS: 59 papers reporting on 53 qualitative studies were included in the synthesis. These studies came from 16 countries (United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, Sweden, Canada, New Zealand, Denmark, Finland, Ghana, Iran, Israel, Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Tanzania, and Thailand). A large proportion of participants thought hypertension was principally caused by stress and produced symptoms, particularly headache, dizziness, and sweating. Participants widely intentionally reduced or stopped treatment without consulting their doctor. Participants commonly perceived that their blood pressure improved when symptoms abated or when they were not stressed, and that treatment was not needed at these times. Participants disliked treatment and its side effects and feared addiction. These findings were consistent across countries and ethnic groups. Participants also reported various external factors that prevented adherence, including being unable to find time to take the drugs or to see the doctor; having insufficient money to pay for treatment; the cost of appointments and healthy food; a lack of health insurance; and forgetfulness. CONCLUSIONS: Non-adherence to hypertension treatment often resulted from patients' understanding of the causes and effects of hypertension; particularly relying on the presence of stress or symptoms to determine if blood pressure was raised. These beliefs were remarkably similar across ethnic and geographical groups; calls for culturally specific education for individual ethnic groups may therefore not be justified. To improve adherence, clinicians and educational interventions must better understand and engage with patients' ideas about causality, experiences of symptoms, and concerns about drug side effects."

Mapping the impact of patient and public involvement on health and social care research: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: There is an increasing international interest in patient and public involvement (PPI) in research, yet relatively little robust evidence exists about its impact on health and social care research. OBJECTIVE: To identify the impact of patient and public involvement on health and social care research. DESIGN: A systematic search of electronic databases and health libraries was undertaken from 1995 to 2009. Data were extracted and quality assessed utilizing the guidelines of the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination 2009 and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). Grey literature was assessed using the Dixon-Woods et al. (2005) checklist. INCLUSION CRITERIA: All study types that reported the impact PPI had on the health and/or social care research study. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 66 studies reporting the impact of PPI on health and social care research were included. The positive impacts identified enhanced the quality and appropriateness of research. Impacts were reported for all stages of research, including the development of user-focused research objectives, development of user-relevant research questions, development of user-friendly information, questionnaires and interview schedules, more appropriate recruitment strategies for studies, consumer-focused interpretation of data and enhanced implementation and dissemination of study results. Some challenging impacts were also identified. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first international evidence of PPI impact that has emerged at all key stages of the research process. However, much of the evidence base concerning impact remains weak and needs significant enhancement in the next decade. Copyright ¬© 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
Measuring Consumer Engagement: A Review of Tools and Findings	"Consumer engagement is increasingly emphasized in healthcare initiatives and has been a priority in healthcare reforms. Consumer engagement takes multiple forms, including increased involvement of consumers in their own care, in organizational design, and in broader policy decision-making processes. Determining the effectiveness of such involvement requires both effective measurement and empirical study, both of which have yet to be standardized or fully explored. In this review, we examine both existing measurement tools for consumer engagement and current empirical knowledge regarding the outcomes associated with each of three levels of consumer engagement. Although measurement and results at the level of direct care are more established, measurement of consumer engagement, let alone its effects at the organizational design or policy level, is less well developed. Building on our review, we make suggestions for how to fill the current gaps in understanding the measurement and outcomes of consumer engagement."
Measuring empowerment among people living with HIV: a systematic review of available measures and their properties.	"A systematic review was conducted to identify and appraise measures of empowerment used in peer-reviewed research with people living with HIV. Thirty articles reporting on 12 scales were identified via keyword and citation searches of electronic databases and hand searching of reference lists. The instruments captured a wide range of constructs, including self-efficacy, perceived knowledge/information seeking, self-management behaviours, belief in an active patient role and tolerance of uncertainty. While the majority of instruments were focused exclusively on self-efficacy to manage HIV, the Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13 and PAM-22) and the Health Empowerment Inventory were broader in scope. Most of the identified measures had acceptable construct validity, however there were insufficient data to determine the reliability or responsiveness of many of the scales. The findings highlight the need for a more concrete definition of empowerment and for further validation of existing measures with people living with HIV."
Measuring medicine-related experiences from the patient perspective: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: There is an increasing drive to measure and so improve patients' experiences and outcomes of health care. This also applies to medicines, given their ubiquity as health care interventions. Patients' experiences of using medicines vary, and instruments which measure these are seen as an essential component to improve care. We aimed to identify generic measures of patients' experiences of using prescription medicines and to examine their properties and suitability for use in research or practice. METHODS: Multiple electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, CINHAL Plus, PROQOLID, and Google Scholar. We identified, critically appraised, and summarized generic questionnaires assessing one or more aspects of the medicine use experience among adult patients using prescription medicines for chronic conditions, and the process of questionnaire development, degree of patient involvement, and/or validation processes. RESULTS: Fifteen questionnaires were included. Of these, nine measures were multidimensional, covering various aspects of medicine use. Six instruments covered only a single domain, assessing a specific facet of using medicines. Domains covered were the following: effectiveness; convenience, practicalities, and/or managing medicines; information, knowledge, and/or understanding; side effects; relationships and/or communication with health professionals; impact on daily living and/or social life; general satisfaction; attitudes; beliefs, concerns, and/or perceptions; medical follow-up and/or adherence-related issues; treatment- and/or medicine-related burden, perceived control, or autonomy; self-confidence about medicine use; availability and accessibility; and medicine-related quality of life. None of the identified questionnaires covered all domains. Instruments varied in the extent of patient involvement in both their development and validation. CONCLUSION: There is a scarcity of psychometrically sound, comprehensive, and generic measures of experiences of using prescription medicines among adult patients living with chronic illnesses. There is a need for further development and/or validation of existing instruments suitable for use in this population."
Measuring participation for children and youth with power mobility needs: A systematic review of potential health measurement tools.	"Objectives To identify and critically appraise potential participation measurement tools for children aged 18 months to 17 years with power mobility (PM) needs. Data Sources Searches in 9 electronic databases identified peer-reviewed publications in English to January 2015, along with hand-searching included bibliographies. Study Selection The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses statement was followed with inclusion criteria set a priori. Keywords and subject headings included participation and measurement terms with descriptors of young people who are potential PM candidates. Publications describing measurement properties of English-language tools were included if the items included >=85% content related to participation and described at least 2 participation dimensions. Data Extraction Two reviewers reached consensus after independently screening titles and abstracts, identifying full-text articles meeting criteria, extracting data, and conducting quality ratings. Tool descriptions, clinical utility, and measurement properties were extracted. Study quality and measurement properties were evaluated using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments checklist and the McMaster Outcome Measures Rating Form. Data Synthesis Of 1330 titles identified, 138 peer-reviewed publications met study inclusion criteria. Fifty tools were identified, of which 20 met inclusion criteria. Evidence supporting reliability and validity varied considerably. Two tools had responsiveness evidence, an important measurement property when evaluating change. Quality ratings were strongest for internal consistency and content validity. Ratings were downgraded because of small sample sizes and a limited description of missing data or study conditions. Conclusions While potential tools emerged (Assessment of Preschool Children's Participation, Preferences for Activities of Children, Child and Adolescent Scale of Participation, Child Engagement in Daily Life, Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, Questionnaire of Young People's Participation), none were judged best suited for use with children having PM needs. Further empirical studies with this population are needed before recommending use for PM applications."
Meta-synthesis of fathers' experiences raising children on the autism spectrum.	"Parents raising children with autism have distinct experiences that influence their well-being, relationships, engagement with the public, and interaction with education and healthcare systems. However, experiences of fathers of children with autism have been largely overlooked by researchers. This meta-synthesis is our synthesis of qualitative accounts of fathers' experiences and we included peer reviewed and gray literature articles that: (1) reported primary qualitative research, (2) included fathers of children with autism as participants, and (3) reported qualitative findings on the first-hand experiences of fathers of children with autism. Studies were appraised for quality and many theoretical and methodological deficiencies identified. Six studies met quality appraisal criteria and three main themes of findings from these studies were generated: (1) adaptation and concern with the future, (2) the importance of cultural context, and (3) reverence for one's child and new opportunities. Fathers' experiences illuminate a need for father-oriented resources that recognize fathers' value in children's lives."
Metrics and Evaluation Tools for Patient Engagement in Healthcare Organization- and System-Level Decision-Making: A Systematic Review.	"BACKGROUND: Patient, public, consumer, and community (P2C2) engagement in organization-, community-, and systemlevel healthcare decision-making is increasing globally, but its formal evaluation remains challenging. To define a taxonomy of possible P2C2 engagement metrics and compare existing evaluation tools against this taxonomy, we conducted a systematic review. METHODS: A broad search strategy was developed for English language publications available from January 1962 through April 2015 in PubMed, Embase, Sociological Abstracts, PsycINFO, EconLit, and the gray literature. A publication was excluded if: (1) the setting was not healthcare delivery (ie, we excluded non-health sectors, such as urban planning; research settings; and public health settings not involving clinical care delivery); (2) the P2C2 engagement was episodic; or (3) the concept of evaluation or possible evaluation metrics were absent. To be included as an evaluation tool, publications had to contain an evaluative instrument that could be employed with minimal modification by a healthcare organization. RESULTS: A total of 199 out of 3953 publications met exclusion and inclusion criteria. These were qualitatively analyzed using inductive content analysis to create a comprehensive taxonomy of 116 possible metrics for evaluating P2C2 engagement. 44 outcome metrics were grouped into three domains (internal, external, and aggregate outcomes) that included six subdomains: impact on engagement participants, impact on services provided by the healthcare organization, impact on the organization itself, influence on the broader public, influence on population health, and engagement cost-effectiveness. The 72 process metrics formed four domains (direct process metrics; surrogate process metrics; aggregate process metrics; and preconditions for engagement) that comprised sixteen subdomains. We identified 23 potential tools for evaluating P2C2 engagement. The identified tools were published between 1973-2015 and varied in their coverage of the taxonomy, methodology used (qualitative, quantitative, or mixed), and intended evaluators (organizational leaders, P2C2 participants, external evaluators, or some combination). Parts of the metric taxonomy were absent from all tools. CONCLUSION: By comprehensively mapping potential outcome and process metrics as well as existing P2C2 engagement tools, this review supports high-quality P2C2 engagement globally by informing the selection of existing evaluation tools and identifying gaps where new tools are needed.

"Metrics of Patient, Public, Consumer, and Community Engagement in Healthcare Systems: How Should We Define Engagement, What Are We Measuring, and Does It Matter for Patient Care? Comment on ""Metrics and Evaluation Tools for Patient Engagement in Healthcare Organization- and System-Level Decision-Making: A Systematic Review""."	"In a rigorous systematic review, Dukhanin and colleagues categorize metrics and evaluative tools of the engagement of patient, public, consumer, and community in decision-making in healthcare institutions and systems. The review itself is ably done and the categorizations lead to a useful understanding of the necessary elements of engagement, and a suite of measures relevant to implementing engagement in systems. Nevertheless, the question remains whether the engagement of patient representatives in institutional or systemic deliberations will lead to improved clinical outcomes or increased engagement of individual patients themselves in care. Attention to the conceptual foundations of patient engagement would help make this systematic review relevant to the clinical care of patients.

Mobile Phone Apps for Quality of Life and Well-Being Assessment in Breast and Prostate Cancer Patients: Systematic Review	"BACKGROUND: Mobile phone health apps are increasingly gaining attention in oncological care as potential tools for supporting cancer patients. Although the number of publications and health apps focusing on cancer is increasing, there are still few specifically designed for the most prevalent cancers diagnosed: breast and prostate cancers. There is a need to review the effect of these apps on breast and prostate cancer patients' quality of life (QoL) and well-being. OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to review the scientific literature on mobile phone apps targeting breast or prostate cancer patients and involving QoL and well-being (anxiety and depression symptoms) and analyze the clinical and technological characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of these apps, as well as patients' user experience with them. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature from The Cochrane Library, Excerpta Medica Database, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and MEDLINE to identify studies involving apps focused on breast and/or prostate cancer patients and QoL and/or well-being published between January 1, 2000, and July 12, 2017. Only trial studies which met the inclusion criteria were selected. The systematic review was completed with a critical analysis of the apps previously identified in the health literature research that were available from the official app stores. RESULTS: The systematic review of the literature yielded 3862 articles. After removal of duplicates, 3229 remained and were evaluated on the basis of title and abstract. Of these, 3211 were discarded as not meeting the inclusion criteria, and 18 records were selected for full text screening. Finally, 5 citations were included in this review, with a total of 644 patients, mean age 52.16 years. Four studies targeted breast cancer patients and 1 focused on prostate cancer patients. Four studies referred to apps that assessed QoL. Only 1 among the 5 analyzed apps was available from the official app store. In 3 studies, an app-related intervention was carried out, and 2 of them reported an improvement on QoL. The lengths of the app-related interventions varied from 4 to 12 weeks. Because 2 of the studies only tracked use of the app, no effect on QoL or well-being was found. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the existence of hundreds of studies involving cancer-focused mobile phone apps, there is a lack of rigorous trials regarding the QoL and/or well-being assessment in breast and/or prostate cancer patients. A strong and collective effort should be made by all health care providers to determine those cancer-focused apps that effectively represent useful, accurate, and reliable tools for cancer patients' disease management.

Narratives of community engagement: a systematic review-derived conceptual framework for public health interventions	"BACKGROUND: Government policy increasingly supports engaging communities to promote health. It is critical to consider whether such strategies are effective, for whom, and under what circumstances. However, 'community engagement' is defined in diverse ways and employed for different reasons. Considering the theory and context we developed a conceptual framework which informs understanding about what makes an effective (or ineffective) community engagement intervention. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of community engagement in public health interventions using: stakeholder involvement; searching, screening, appraisal and coding of research literature; and iterative thematic syntheses and meta-analysis. A conceptual framework of community engagement was refined, following interactions between the framework and each review stage. RESULTS: From 335 included reports, three products emerged: (1) two strong theoretical 'meta-narratives': one, concerning the theory and practice of empowerment/engagement as an independent objective; and a more utilitarian perspective optimally configuring health services to achieve defined outcomes. These informed (2) models that were operationalized in subsequent meta-analysis. Both refined (3) the final conceptual framework. This identified multiple dimensions by which community engagement interventions may differ. Diverse combinations of intervention purpose, theory and implementation were noted, including: ways of defining communities and health needs; initial motivations for community engagement; types of participation; conditions and actions necessary for engagement; and potential issues influencing impact. Some dimensions consistently co-occurred, leading to three overarching models of effective engagement which either: utilised peer-led delivery; employed varying degrees of collaboration between communities and health services; or built on empowerment philosophies. CONCLUSIONS: Our conceptual framework and models are useful tools for considering appropriate and effective approaches to community engagement. These should be tested and adapted to facilitate intervention design and evaluation. Using this framework may disentangle the relative effectiveness of different models of community engagement, promoting effective, sustainable and appropriate initiatives."
"Once a clinician, always a clinician: a systematic review to develop a typology of clinician-researcher dual-role experiences in health research with patient-participants"	"BACKGROUND: Many health researchers are clinicians. Dual-role experiences are common for clinician-researchers in research involving patient-participants, even if not their own patients. To extend the existing body of literature on why dual-role is experienced, we aimed to develop a typology of common catalysts for dual-role experiences to help clinician-researchers plan and implement methodologically and ethically sound research. METHODS: Systematic searching of Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase and Scopus (inception to 28.07.2014) for primary studies or first-person reflexive reports of clinician-researchers' dual-role experiences, supplemented by reference list checking and Google Scholar scoping searches. Included articles were loaded in NVivo for analysis. The coding was focused on how dual-role was evidenced for the clinician-researchers in research involving patients. Procedures were completed by one researcher (MB) and independently cross-checked by another (JHS). All authors contributed to extensive discussions to resolve all disagreements about initial coding and verify the final themes. RESULTS: Database searching located 7135 records, resulting in 29 included studies, with the addition of 7 studies through reference checks and scoping searches. Two overarching themes described the most common catalysts for dual-role experiences - ways a research role can involve patterns of behaviour typical of a clinical role, and the developing connection that starts to resemble a clinician-patient relationship. Five subthemes encapsulated the clinical patterns commonly repeated in research settings (clinical queries, perceived agenda, helping hands, uninvited clinical expert, and research or therapy) and five subthemes described concerns about the researcher-participant relationship (clinical assumptions, suspicion and holding back, revelations, over-identification, and manipulation). Clinician-researchers use their clinical skills in health research in ways that set up a relationship resembling that of clinician-patient. Clinicians' ingrained orientation to patients' needs can be in tension with their research role, and can set up ethical and methodological challenges. CONCLUSION: The typology we developed outlines the common ways dual-role is experienced in research involving clinician-researchers and patient-participants, and perhaps the inevitability of the experience given the primacy accorded to patient well-being. The typology offers clinician-researchers a framework for grappling with the ethical and methodological implications of dual-role throughout the research process, including planning, implementation, monitoring and reporting."
Opportunities and challenges in public and community engagement: the connected for cognitive health in later life (CHILL) project.	"Plain English summary: Two goals of public health research are to understand what causes disease and ill health, and what can be done to prevent it. To develop appropriate and effective actions, we need to know what resources are available to communities, and what are the beliefs and values that influence behaviour. This means that research needs to be carried out close to the people it affects, to better understand context and environment, as well as people's understandings and interpretations of health and health risk.Connected for Cognitive Health in Later Life (CHILL) was a project developed to test whether engaging local residents in research might be a good way of firstly: raising awareness of research findings in the community; and secondly, affecting mid-life behaviours in favour of ageing well and reducing risk of dementia. We investigated perceptions of ageing and how to age 'well' in a town whose population health is ranked worse than the regional average. Project activities involved: identifying and engaging with stakeholders; conducting 'mini' street interviews; holding community workshops; and taking part in a large community event.This paper describes the process of carrying out the research, and presents a flavour of some of the information captured on context and local understanding of dementia risk. It then goes on to discuss in more depth some of the challenges in attempting to involve people in shaping research and intervention development, before offering some conclusions and suggested next steps for researchers. Abstract: Background Identifying risk of disease and ill health, and developing prevention strategies, are key objectives in public health research. However, poor understanding of the impact of local context, including cultural and ethnic differences, challenges our ability to develop actions that are acceptable and meaningful to local communities. This suggests a need for research embedded in sub-populations, seeking to better understand context, understanding and interpretation of health and health risk. Methods Against a backdrop of wide inequalities in health, the Connected for Cognitive Health In Later Life (CHILL) project began work in a locality with worse than regional average health outcomes aiming to co-develop a project investigating perceptions of ageing and how to age 'well'. Another goal was to test the potential for using Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) as a way of communicating research knowledge, raising awareness and understanding amongst community members of mid-life risk factors for developing dementia. A four-part scoping study was embarked on, including: stakeholder identification and engagement; street interviews; community workshops; and a wider public engagement event. Results Whilst the project was able to stimulate interest, gain involvement from a small group of residents, and successfully engage members of the public, it was not possible, within the relatively short timescale of the scoping project, to achieve the depth of community involvement necessary to co-design and seek additional funding for collaborative research activities. Conclusions A number of challenges were encountered in scoping CBPR on this particular topic and location. Potential explanations include lack of 'readiness' or 'capacity' amongst the local population, and a very limited timescale for the scoping research to adapt and respond to this. This has significant implications in terms of time and effort necessary to build infrastructure to support research partnerships if researchers wish to engage successfully with members of the public on population health in the future."
"Optimizing patient and public involvement (PPI): Identifying its ""essential"" and ""desirable"" principles using a systematic review and modified Delphi methodology."	"BACKGROUND: There is international interest in the active involvement of patients and the public. However, consensus on how best to optimize its application is currently unavailable. OBJECTIVE: To identify and assess the underlying principles of patient and public involvement (PPI) in health and social care services, research, education and regulation across medicine, dentistry and nursing. DESIGN: A four-phase methodology: (i) an extensive systematic review of published and grey literature; (ii) inductive thematic analysis of review findings; (iii) development of best practice principles; and (iv) consensus testing of identified principles using a modified Delphi methodology. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Twelve systematic reviews and 88 grey literature publications were reviewed leading to the unique identification of 13 principles later assessed by 18 PPI experts. RESULTS: Essential consensus (>75% agreement) was obtained for nine principles reviewed. Working in equal partnership and sharing information achieved the highest consensus rates: 16/17 essential 94.1%; 1/17 desirable 5.8%. The four remaining principles that failed to reach essential consensus were categorized as desirable by expert respondents. No principles were considered irrelevant. No alternatives were suggested. DISCUSSION: Expert respondents suggest essential principles must be achieved to optimize PPI best practice. To advance PPI practice, desirable principles should also be aspired to wherever possible. CONCLUSIONS: This study's innovative approach advances existing knowledge by providing previously unavailable consensus about PPI best practice. Research findings hold important theoretical and practical implications for educators, regulators, researchers and practitioners looking to effectively work together.

Organizational participatory research: a systematic mixed studies review exposing its extra benefits and the key factors associated with them	"BACKGROUND: In health, organizational participatory research (OPR) refers to health organization members participating in research decisions, with university researchers, throughout a study. This non-academic partner contribution to the research may take the form of consultation or co-construction. A drawback of OPR is that it requires more time from all those involved, compared to non-participatory research approaches; thus, understanding the added value of OPR, if any, is important. Thus, we sought to assess whether the OPR approach leads to benefits beyond what could be achieved through traditional research. METHODS: We identified, selected, and appraised OPR health literature, and at each stage, two team members independently reviewed and coded the literature. We used quantitative content analysis to transform textual data into reliable numerical codes and conducted a logistic regression to test the hypothesis that a co-construction type OPR study yields extra benefits with a greater likelihood than consultation-type OPR studies. RESULTS: From 8873 abstracts and 992 full text papers, we distilled a sample of 107 OPR studies. We found no difference between the type of organization members' participation and the likelihood of exhibiting an extra benefit. However, the likelihood of an OPR study exhibiting at least one extra benefit is quadrupled when the impetus for the study comes from the organization, rather than the university researcher(s), or the organization and the university researcher(s) together (OR = 4.11, CI = 1.12-14.01). We also defined five types of extra benefits. CONCLUSIONS: This review describes the types of extra benefits OPR can yield and suggests these benefits may occur if the organization initiates the OPR. Further, this review exposes a need for OPR authors to more clearly describe the type of non-academic partner participation in key research decisions throughout the study. Detailed descriptions will benefit others conducting OPR and allow for a re-examination of the relationship between participation and extra benefits in future reviews."
Organizing and delivering diabetes education and self-care support: findings of scoping project	"OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of current research and development on the organization and delivery of diabetes education and self-care support, incorporating stakeholder perspectives. METHOD: Four methods were used: literature review (159 papers and 52 grey literature items); patient participation event (n = 38); online survey of professionals (n = 423) and patients (n= 495); and, a conference. RESULTS: The literature review identified themes relating to the organization and delivery of diabetes and self-care support: structure and flexibility in models of education; accessibility; patient choice; integrating self-care within the overall care system; quality improvement; peer educators; health literacy; efficiency in delivery; telecare models; feedback technologies; care planning; psychological intervention; and self-care outcome measures. This generated four models to provide a framework to help shape the development of diabetes self-care: a diabetes education pathway; integrating self-care and clinical care; choice as a method of optimizing care; and an integrated framework for delivering diabetes self-care. CONCLUSION: The clinical benefit of the identified models need to be evaluated."
Patient and public engagement in research and health system decision making: A systematic review of evaluation tools.	"BACKGROUND: Patient and public engagement is growing, but evaluative efforts remain limited. Reviews looking at evaluation tools for patient engagement in individual decision making do exist, but no similar articles in research and health systems have been published. OBJECTIVE: Systematically review and appraise evaluation tools for patient and public engagement in research and health system decision making. METHODS: We searched literature published between January 1980 and February 2016. Electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL and PsycINFO) were consulted, as well as grey literature obtained through Google, subject-matter experts, social media and engagement organization websites. Two independent reviewers appraised the evaluation tools based on 4 assessment criteria: scientific rigour, patient and public perspective, comprehensiveness and usability. RESULTS: In total, 10 663 unique references were identified, 27 were included. Most of these tools were developed in the last decade and were designed to support improvement of engagement activities. Only 11% of tools were explicitly based on a literature review, and just 7% were tested for reliability. Patients and members of the public were involved in designing 56% of the tools, mainly in the piloting stage, and 18.5% of tools were designed to report evaluation results to patients and the public. CONCLUSION: A growing number of evaluation tools are available to support patient and public engagement in research and health system decision making. However, the scientific rigour with which such evaluation tools are developed could be improved, as well as the level of patient and public engagement in their design and reporting.

Patient and public involvement and the implementation of research into practice	"Purpose Patient and public involvement (PPI) is increasingly central to the delivery of health services research. However, it has proved challenging to evaluate the impact of PPI on the implementation of research into clinical practice and health service delivery. The purpose of this paper is to develop and test a conceptual model explaining how PPI in the research process might impact on implementation.Design/methodology/approach A scoping review of knowledge translation and implementation science literature was performed to develop a conceptual model of the impact of PPI in research on implementation. A retrospective case study of a research project was used to illustrate the model.Findings The authors identified five domains in which PPI can impact on the implementation of research into practice. The review demonstrated that successful implementation depends on developing relational models of knowledge production, valuing experiential knowledge, engaging in collaborative practice, making use of knowledge brokers or tools for knowledge facilitation and embedding these factors into the implementation context. In the case study the authors were able to find examples that illustrated each of the five domains of the model.Originality/value The paper builds on existing endeavour to evaluate the impact of PPI in research, demonstrating that it is possible to model, conceptually, the processes whereby PPI in research might impact on practice and service delivery. By illustrating those processes through the exemplar case the authors also demonstrate the potential for the model to be ÄúoperationalisedÄù, allowing the impacts, on practice, of PPI in research to be systematically and directly evidenced."
Patient and public involvement in clinical practice guidelines: a knowledge synthesis of existing programs.	"BACKGROUND: Reviewers independently extracted data on key components of PPIPs and barriers and facilitators to their operation. Data synthesis. Over half of the studies were published after 2002, and more than half originated from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany. CPGs that involved patients and the public addressed a variety of health problems, especially mental health and cancer. The most frequently cited objective for using PPIPs in developing CPGs was to incorporate patients' values or perspectives in CPG recommendations. Patients and their families and caregivers were the parties most often involved. METHODS: used to recruit PPIP participants included soliciting through patient/public organizations, sending invitations, and receiving referrals and recruits from clinicians. Patients and the public most often participated by taking part in a CPG working group, workshop, meeting, seminar, literature review, or consultation such as a focus group, individual interview, or survey. Patients and the public principally helped formulate recommendations and revise drafts. Limitations. The authors did not contact the authors of the studies. CONCLUSION: This literature review provides an extensive knowledge base for making PPIPs more effective when developing and implementing CPGs. More research is needed to assess the impact of PPIPs and resources they require."
Patient and public involvement in health literacy interventions: a mapping review.	"Plain English summary: If people can read, understand and act on health information to better their health and reduce illness, they are thought to have ""adequate"" health literacy. Poor health literacy can mean people are less able to access health care and manage their health. Health literacy tends to worsen as adults get older, and is especially poor in adults age 65 and over. Ideally, health literacy interventions target people before age 65, to establish good skills and habits before people have many health problems associated with ageing. It is also good if researchers consult ordinary people, including patients and the public (PPI) when planning a programme to try to improve health literacy. This may help ensure individual needs are catered for.We therefore looked for studies that described any role of patient or public representatives in the research planning stages. We explored how the representatives contributed to each project. We found only 20 studies that included people other than the research team. Lack of reporting and consultation with patient and public representatives may contribute to less success when public health programmes are undertaken. Abstract: Background: Health literacy is the ability to understand, access and use health care and is a critical mediating factor that affects the health of older adults. Patient and public involvement in health and social care research, policy and design of care delivery is one mechanism that can promote production of better health literacy. This mapping review looks for and describes practices, concepts and methods that have been reported involving patients and public in the development and design of health literacy interventions for older people. Methods: Studies for the present review were selected from an inventory of health behaviour studies published between 2003 and 2013. The inventory was created by systematic searches on bibliographic databases (Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, Google) for health literacy interventions involving older people (50+ years) and resulted in screening of 5561 articles, of which 1097 met study inclusion criteria. For the research described in this article 96 of the 1097 studies specifically focused on health literacy and were independently screened by two reviewers to assess involvement of stakeholders other than investigators and participants. Results: Twenty studies included patient and/or public involvement in at least one research domain: design, management or evaluation. Involvement included volunteers, older people, patients, and/or community representatives. Conclusions: Patient and public involvement were rarely reported in studies on health literacy interventions for older people. Future intervention development needs high quality PPI, which is well reported to develop the evidence base and inform practice."
Patient and public involvement in health research in low and middle-income countries: a systematic review.	"OBJECTIVES: Patient and public involvement (PPI) is argued to lead to higher quality health research, which is more relatable to and helps empower the public. We synthesised the evidence to look for examples of PPI in health research in low/middle-income countries (LMICs), looking at levels of involvement and impact. Additionally, we considered the impact of who was undertaking the research on the level of involvement and reported impact. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: EMBASE, Medline and PsychINFO, along with hand-searching references, grey literature, Google search and expert advice. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Any health research with evidence of patient or public involvement, with no language restrictions dated from 1978 to 1 Dec 2017. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data relating to stage and level of involvement, as well as impact, were extracted by one researcher (NC), and a coding framework was developed using an inductive approach to examine the impact of PPI on research. Extracted data were then independently coded by a second lay researcher (RK) to validate the data being collected. Discrepancies were referred to a third independent reviewer (MT) for review and consensus reached. RESULTS: Sixty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. The review revealed the most common stage for PPI was in research planning, and the most common level of involvement was collaboration. Most studies did not provide evidence of effectiveness or elaborate on the impact of PPI, and they tended to report impact from the researcher's perspective. Where impact was mentioned, this generally related to increased relevance to the community, empowerment of participants and alterations in study design. CONCLUSIONS: The literature describing approaches to and impact of PPI on LMIC health research is sparse. As PPI is essential to conducting high-quality research, it should be fully reported and evaluated at the end of the research project. Copyright ¬© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Patient and public involvement in medical performance processes: A systematic review	"BACKGROUND: Patient and public involvement (PPI) continues to develop as a central policy agenda in health care. The patient voice is seen as relevant, informative and can drive service improvement. However, critical exploration of PPI's role within monitoring and informing medical performance processes remains limited. OBJECTIVE: To explore and evaluate the contribution of PPI in medical performance processes to understand its extent, purpose and process. SEARCH STRATEGY: The electronic databases PubMed, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were systematically searched for studies published between 2004 and 2018. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies involving doctors and patients and all forms of patient input (eg, patient feedback) associated with medical performance were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Using an inductive approach to analysis and synthesis, a coding framework was developed which was structured around three key themes: issues that shape PPI in medical performance processes; mechanisms for PPI; and the potential impacts of PPI on medical performance processes. MAIN RESULTS: From 4772 studies, 48 articles (from 10 countries) met the inclusion criteria. Findings suggest that the extent of PPI in medical performance processes globally is highly variable and is primarily achieved through providing patient feedback or complaints. The emerging evidence suggests that PPI can encourage improvements in the quality of patient care, enable professional development and promote professionalism. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Developing more innovative methods of PPI beyond patient feedback and complaints may help revolutionize the practice of PPI into a collaborative partnership, facilitating the development of proactive relationships between the medical profession, patients and the public.

Patient and public involvement in the design of clinical trials: An overview of systematic reviews	"BACKGROUND: Funders encourage lay-volunteer inclusion in research. There are controversy and resistance, given concerns of role confusion, exploratory methods, and limited evidence about what value lay-volunteers bring to research. This overview explores these areas. METHODS: Eleven databases were searched without date or language restrictions for systematic reviews of public and patient involvement (PPI) in clinical trials design. This systematic overview of PPI included 27 reviews from which areas of good and bad practice were identified. Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of PPI were explored through use of meta-narrative analysis. RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were met by 27 reviews ranging in quality from high (n = 7), medium (n = 14) to low (n = 6) reviews. Reviews were assessed using CERQUAL NICE, CASP for qualitative research and CASP for systematic reviews. Four reviews report risk of bias. Public involvement roles were primarily in agenda setting, steering committees, ethical review, protocol development, and piloting. Research summaries, follow-up, and dissemination contained PPI, with lesser involvement in data collection, analysis, or manuscript authoring. Trialists report difficulty in finding, retaining, and reimbursing volunteers. Respectful inclusion, role recognition, mutual flexibility, advance planning, and sound methods were reported as facilitating public involvement in research. Public involvement was reported to have increased the quantity and quality of patient relevant priorities and outcomes, enrollment, funding, design, implementation, and dissemination. Challenges identified include lack of clarity within common language, roles, and research boundaries, while logistical needs include extra time, training, and funding. Researchers report struggling to report involvement and avoid tokenism. CONCLUSIONS: Involving patients and the public in clinical trials design can be beneficial but requires resources, preparation, training, flexibility, and time. Issues to address include reporting deficits for risk of bias, study quality, and conflicts of interests. We need to address these tensions and improve dissemination strategies to increase PPI and health literacy. Copyright ¬© 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"Patient and public involvement in the design, administration and evaluation of patient feedback tools, an example in psychiatry: a systematic review and critical interpretative synthesis."	"BACKGROUND: Patient feedback is considered integral to healthcare design, delivery and reform. However, while there is a strong policy commitment to evidencing patient and public involvement (PPI) in the design of patient feedback tools, it remains unclear whether this happens in practice. METHODS: A systematic review using thematic analysis and critical interpretative synthesis of peer-reviewed and grey literature published between 2007 and 2017 exploring the presence of PPI in the design, administration and evaluation of patient feedback tools for practising psychiatrists. The research process was carried out in collaboration with a volunteer mental health patient research partner. RESULTS: Fourteen articles (10 peer-reviewed, four grey literature) discussing the development of nine patient feedback tools were included. Six of the nine tools reviewed were designed from a professional perspective only. Tool content and its categorization primarily remained at the professional's discretion. Patient participation rates, presence of missing data and psychometric validation were used to determine validity and patient acceptability. In most instances, patients remained passive recipients with limited opportunity to actively influence change at any stage. No article reviewed reported PPI in all aspects of tool design, administration or evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patient feedback tools are designed, administered and evaluated from the professional perspective only. Existing tools appear to assume that: professional and patient agendas are synonymous; psychometric validation is indicative of patient acceptability; and psychiatric patients do not have the capacity or desire to be involved. Future patient feedback tools should be co-produced from the outset to ensure they are valued by all those involved. A reconsideration of the purpose of patient feedback, and what constitutes valid patient feedback, is also required."
Patient engagement as a risk factor in personalized health care: a systematic review of the literature on chronic disease.	"BACKGROUND: The role of patient engagement as an important risk factor for healthcare outcomes has not been well established. The objective of this article was to systematically review the relationship between patient engagement and health outcomes in chronic disease to determine whether patient engagement should be quantified as an important risk factor in health risk appraisals to enhance the practice of personalized medicine. METHODS: A systematic review of prospective clinical trials conducted between January 1993 and December 2012 was performed. Articles were identified through a medical librarian-conducted multi-term search of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Additional studies were obtained from the references of meta-analyses and systematic reviews on hypertension, diabetes, and chronic care. Search terms included variations of the following: self-care, self-management, self-monitoring, (shared) decision-making, patient education, patient motivation, patient engagement, chronic disease, chronically ill, and randomized controlled trial. Studies were included only if they: (1) compared patient engagement interventions to an appropriate control among adults with chronic disease aged 18 years and older; (2) had minimum 3 months between pre- and post-intervention measurements; and (3) defined patient engagement as: (a) understanding the importance of taking an active role in one's health and health care; (b) having the knowledge, skills, and confidence to manage health; and (c) using knowledge, skills and confidence to perform health-promoting behaviors. Three authors and two research assistants independently extracted data using predefined fields including quality metrics. RESULTS: We reviewed 543 abstracts to identify 10 trials that met full inclusion criteria, four of which had 'high' methodological quality (Jadad score >= 3). Diverse measurement of patient engagement prevented robust statistical analyses, so data were qualitatively described. Nine studies documented improvements in patient engagement. Five studies reported reduction in clinical markers of disease (for example HbA1C). All studies reported improvements in self-reported health status. CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests patient engagement should be quantified as part of a comprehensive health risk appraisal given its apparent value in helping individuals to effectively self-manage chronic disease. Patient engagement measures should include assessment of the knowledge, confidence and skills to prevent and manage chronic disease, plus the behaviors to do so."
Patient engagement in Canada: a scoping review of the 'how' and 'what' of patient engagement in health research	"BACKGROUND: Over the last 10 years, patient engagement in health research has emerged as the next evolution in healthcare research. However, limited evidence about the clear role and scope of patient engagement in health research and a lack of evidence about its impact have influenced the uptake, implementation and ongoing evolution of patient engagement. The present study aims to conduct a scoping review to identify methods for and outcomes of patient engagement in health research. METHODS: An adaptation of the scoping review methodology originally described by Arksey and O'Malley and updated by Levac, Colquhoun and O'Brien was applied. Sources from a formal database search and relevant documents from a grey literature search were compiled into data extraction tables. Articles were synthesised into key themes according to the (1) methods and (2) outcomes of patient engagement in health research. RESULTS: The total yield for the scoping review was 55 records from across Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. While evidence about the methods used to engage patients in health research is increasing, stronger evidence of specific patient and healthcare system outcomes is required. This necessitates further mobilisation of research that explores outcomes and that validates specific tools to evaluate engagement. Additionally, theoretical frameworks that can better inform and sustain patient engagement across the lifecycle of health research are lacking. CONCLUSION: Further increasing the volume and reach of evidence about patient engagement in health research will support the paradigmatic shift needed to normalise the patient's role in research beyond 'subject' or 'participant', so as to ultimately improve patient health outcomes and better address healthcare reform in Canada."
Patient Engagement In Health Care Safety: An Overview Of Mixed-Quality Evidence	"Patients and caregivers play a central role in health care safety in the hospital, ambulatory care setting, and community. Despite this, interventions to promote patient engagement in safety are still underexplored. We conducted an overview of review articles on patient engagement interventions in safety to examine the current state of the evidence. Of the 2,795 references we evaluated, 52 articles met our full-text inclusion criteria for synthesis in 2018. We identified robust evidence supporting patients' self-management of anticoagulation medications and mixed-quality evidence supporting patient engagement in medication and chronic disease self-management, adverse event reporting, and medical record accuracy. Promising modes of patient engagement in safety, such as anticoagulation management and patient portal access, are not widely implemented. We discuss major implementation priorities and propose directions for future research and policy to enhance patient partnership within safety efforts."
Patient engagement in hospital health service planning and improvement: a scoping review	"OBJECTIVES: Patient engagement (PE) improves patient, organisation and health system outcomes, but most research is based on primary care. The primary purpose of this study was to describe the characteristics of published empirical research that evaluated PE in hospital health service improvement. DESIGN: Scoping review. METHODS: Five databases were searched from 2006 to September 2016. English language studies that evaluated patient or provider beliefs, participation in PE, influencing factors or impact were eligible. Screening and data extraction were done in triplicate. PE characteristics, influencing factors and impact were extracted and summarised. RESULTS: From a total of 3939 search results, 227 studies emerged as potentially relevant; of these, 217 were not eligible, and 10 studies were included in the review. None evaluated behavioural interventions to promote or support PE. While most studies examined involvement in standing committees or projects, patient input and influence on decisions were minimal. Lack of skill and negative beliefs among providers were PE barriers. PE facilitators included careful selection and joint training of patients and providers, formalising patient roles, informal interaction to build trust, involving patients early in projects, small team size, frequent meetings, active solicitation of patient input in meetings and debriefing after meetings. Asking patients to provide insight into problems rather than solutions and deploying provider champions may enhance patient influence on hospital services. CONCLUSIONS: Given the important role of PE in improving hospital services and the paucity of research on this topic, future research should develop and evaluate behavioural interventions for PE directed at patients and providers informed by the PE barriers and facilitators identified here. Future studies should also assess the impact on various individual and organisational outcomes.

Patient engagement in randomized controlled tai chi clinical trials among the chronically ill.	"Background: Physicians encounter various symptom-based complaints each day. While physicians strive to support patients with chronic illnesses, evidence indicates that patients who are actively involved in their health care have better health outcomes and sometimes lowers costs. Aim: This article is to analyze how patient engagement is described when complex interventions such as Tai Chi were delivered in Randomized Controlled clinical Trials (RCTs). It reviews the dynamic patient-physician relationship in chronic illness management and to illustrate the patient engagement process, using Tai Chi as an example intervention. Methods: RCTs are considered the gold standard in clinical research. This study is a qualitative analysis of RCTs using Tai Chi as an intervention. A systematic literature search was performed to identify quality randomized controlled clinical trials that investigated the effects of Tai Chi. Selected clinical trials were classified according to research design, intervention style, patient engagement, and outcomes. Patient engagement was classified based on levels of patient participation, compliance, and self management. The chronic health conditions included in this paper are Parkinson's disease, polyneuropathy, hypertension, stroke, chronic insomnia, chronic heart failure, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, central obesity, depression, deconditioning in the elderly, or being pre-clinically disabled. Results and conclusion: We found that patient engagement, as a concept, was not well defined in literature. It covers a wide range of related terms, such as patient involvement, participation, shared decision making, patient activation, adherence, compliance, and self-management. Tai Chi, as a very complex practice system, is to balance all aspects of a patient's life; however, the level of patient engagement is difficult to describe using conventional clinical trial design. To accurately illustrate the effect of a complex intervention, novel research design must explore ways to measure patient engagement in the intervention in order to clarify its specific role on health."
Patient engagement in research related to dementia: A scoping review	"Patient 'engagement' or 'involvement' in health research broadly refers to including people with lived experience (i.e. individuals with personal experience of a health issue and their friends, family and caregivers or carers) in the research process. Although previous reviews have systematically summarized approaches to patient engagement in research, it is unclear whether and how engagement activities have been implemented or adapted for research related to dementia. We conducted a scoping review to describe the extent and nature of patient engagement approaches that have been used to involve persons with dementia and their care partners in research. We then summarized the reported barriers, enablers, and impacts of this engagement. Fifty-four research articles were included in the review and almost all were published after 2010. Persons with dementia and their care partners have been engaged in diverse phases of the research process. The majority of engagement involved both persons with dementia and care partners. Barriers and enablers to engagement included those identified for general patient engagement in research, but some more specific to engaging persons with dementia and their care partners were also reported. Very few studies assessed the impact of patient engagement. While the arguments for patient engagement in research are compelling, research to demonstrate the impact - on the research process and outcomes as well as on persons with dementia, care partners, researchers, research institutions and society - is still needed."
Patient engagement in research with older adults with cancer.	"Objective Cancer is a disease that mostly affects older adults. Older adults have been under-represented in clinical cancer research. Around the world there is a push for patient engagement on study teams as it is anticipated to improve study design, recruitment and dissemination of findings. In the current overview we examined the evidence with regard to: 1) the history of patient engagement in research and frameworks developed; 2) impact of patient engagement on patient and research outcomes; 3) use of patient engagement in geriatrics and oncology, 4) recommendations for successful engagement; and 5) gaps in the literature that should be studied further. Methods A narrative review was conducted. Articles published in English were searched in Medline with the help of a librarian. Results Patient engagement has been shown to improve the conduct of studies by making the study design more relevant and feasible, and improving recruitment rates and uptake of research findings by patients. However, the best way to engage patients is not clear yet. Several resources have been developed to support researchers engaging older adults with cancer in research. Conclusions While patient engagement in research seems promising to improve study outcomes, little evidence is available thus far in geriatric oncology settings. Several gaps in the literature are identified that should be further studied to determine the value of, and best approaches to, patient engagement with older adults with cancer."
Patient engagement in research: a systematic review	"BACKGROUND: A compelling ethical rationale supports patient engagement in healthcare research. It is also assumed that patient engagement will lead to research findings that are more pertinent to patients' concerns and dilemmas. However; it is unclear how to best conduct this process. In this systematic review we aimed to answer 4 key questions: what are the best ways to identify patient representatives? How to engage them in designing and conducting research? What are the observed benefits of patient engagement? What are the harms and barriers of patient engagement? METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Cochrane, EBSCO, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Business Search Premier, Academic Search Premier and Google Scholar. Included studies were published in English, of any size or design that described engaging patients or their surrogates in research design. We conducted an environmental scan of the grey literature and consulted with experts and patients. Data were analyzed using a non-quantitative, meta-narrative approach. RESULTS: We included 142 studies that described a spectrum of engagement. In general, engagement was feasible in most settings and most commonly done in the beginning of research (agenda setting and protocol development) and less commonly during the execution and translation of research. We found no comparative analytic studies to recommend a particular method. Patient engagement increased study enrollment rates and aided researchers in securing funding, designing study protocols and choosing relevant outcomes. The most commonly cited challenges were related to logistics (extra time and funding needed for engagement) and to an overarching worry of a tokenistic engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Patient engagement in healthcare research is likely feasible in many settings. However, this engagement comes at a cost and can become tokenistic. Research dedicated to identifying the best methods to achieve engagement is lacking and clearly needed."
Patient Engagement In Research: Early Findings From The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute.	"Charged with ensuring that research produces useful evidence to inform health decisions, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) requires investigators to engage patients and other health care stakeholders, such as clinicians and payers, in the research process. Many PCORI studies result in articles published in peer-reviewed journals that detail research findings and engagement's role in research. To inform practices for engaging patients and others as research partners, we analyzed 126 articles that described engagement approaches and contributions to research. PCORI projects engaged patients and others as consultants and collaborators in determining the study design, selecting study outcomes, tailoring interventions to meet patients' needs and preferences, and enrolling participants. Many articles reported that engagement provided valuable contributions to research feasibility, acceptability, rigor, and relevance, while a few noted trade-offs of engagement. The findings suggest that engagement can support more relevant research through better alignment with patients' and clinicians' real-world needs and concerns."
Patient engagement in the inpatient setting: a systematic review	"OBJECTIVE: To systematically review existing literature regarding patient engagement technologies used in the inpatient setting. METHODS: PubMed, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore, and Cochrane databases were searched for studies that discussed patient engagement ('self-efficacy', 'patient empowerment', 'patient activation', or 'patient engagement'), (2) involved health information technology ('technology', 'games', 'electronic health record', 'electronic medical record', or 'personal health record'), and (3) took place in the inpatient setting ('inpatient' or 'hospital'). Only English language studies were reviewed. RESULTS: 17 articles were identified describing the topic of inpatient patient engagement. A few articles identified design requirements for inpatient engagement technology. The remainder described interventions, which we grouped into five categories: entertainment, generic health information delivery, patient-specific information delivery, advanced communication tools, and personalized decision support. CONCLUSIONS: Examination of the current literature shows there are considerable gaps in knowledge regarding patient engagement in the hospital setting and inconsistent use of terminology regarding patient engagement overall. Research on inpatient engagement technologies has been limited, especially concerning the impact on health outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Patient involvement in a qualitative meta-synthesis: lessons learnt.	"PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: Patients and researchers must work together to improve the relevance and quality of research. Qualitative systematic reviews synthesise findings from a range of published qualitative studies to identify common themes, and can make recommendations for practice or future research. The process of conducting a systemic review offers multiple opportunities for patient involvement.This paper explores the reflections of patient research partners involved in a qualitative systematic review. Patient partners were asked how their experience of the review process could be used to improve patient involvement in future qualitative systematic reviews. Following involvement in a systematic review an exploratory questionnaire was emailed to eight patient research partners. Open ended questions focussed on the training they had received, whether they had enjoyed taking part and how the process could be improved. Patients stated that they needed clear instructions and examples of how to take part in the systematic review. Face to face training was preferred, and it was important that patients were given enough time to complete the task. The study led to benefits for patients including gaining new skills and improved confidence. Each patient also wanted to know how their comments had influenced the paper and wanted feedback on whether they needed any further training. Through reflection with patient partners, recommendations for the involvement of patients in qualitative systematic reviews were developed to allow researchers to successfully involve patients in the review process. ABSTRACT: Background Patient involvement in systematic reviews is seen as good practice, yet there is a lack of accessible standardised training for those involved. The aim of this paper is to inform the evidence base on effective ways of involving patients in a qualitative meta-synthesis. This process is evaluated and reflected by patient research partners (PRPs) who provided accounts of their experience. Methods An open ended questionnaire was emailed to eight PRPs who had participated in the analysis of a qualitative meta-synthesis. Questions focussed on the training they received, their experience of coding data and identifying themes, whether they enjoyed taking part in the project and how the process could be improved. Results Our findings point to the importance of detailed training for PRPs, using plain English and clear examples of analysis techniques to improve confidence in engaging with meta-synthesis methods. Face to face training was preferred in order to discuss a PRP's understanding of the task ahead. Time is an important consideration as PRPs often complete this work on top of their daily commitments and need the time and on-going support to be able to immerse themselves in the data. A focus group was a useful way to discuss the themes but it is important that PRPs understand how their comments have influenced the paper. PRPs reported benefits that included building new skills, improving confidence and gaining knowledge. They also asked for feedback on their contribution and any further training needs. All PRPs said they would take part in a meta-synthesis in the future as long as these considerations were addressed. Conclusion The recommendations for practice identified in this paper, and guidelines for training, can assist researchers in collaborating with PRPs when developing and conducting a qualitative meta-synthesis."
Patient involvement in a systematic review: Development and pilot evaluation of a patient workshop.	"Patient involvement (PI) in research is increasingly required as a means to improve relevance and meaningfulness of research results. PI has been widely promoted by the National Institute for Health Research in England in the last years. In Germany, widespread involvement of patients in research is still missing. The methods used to realize PI have been developed mainly in English research contexts, and detailed information on how to involve patients in systematic reviews is rare. Therefore, the aim of the study was that patients contribute and prioritize clinically relevant outcomes to a systematic review on meta-cognitive interventions, and to evaluate a patient workshop as well as patients' perceptions of research involvement. Seven patients with experience in psychiatric care participated in our workshop. They focused on outcomes pre-defined in the review protocol (e.g., meta-cognitive or cognitive changes, symptomatology, quality of life), neglected other outcomes (like satisfaction with treatment, acceptability), and added relevant new ones (e.g., scope of action/autonomy, applicability). Altogether, they valued the explicit workshop participation positively. However, some suggested to involve patients at an earlier stage and to adapt the amount of information given. Further systematic reviews would benefit from the involvement of patients in the definition of other components of the review question (like patients or interventions), in the interpretation of key findings or in drafting a lay summary.

Patient participation in a Clinical Guideline Development for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	"OBJECTIVE: To incorporate patients' perspective in the design of a clinical practice guideline (CPG) for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in Spain. METHODS: A systematic review (SR) of literature and a Delphi-based consultation to patients were carried out. RESULTS: From the SR, most relevant health problems are classified as physical, psychological, familial, and socio-economic. Dissatisfaction is mainly due to unmet information needs and limited access to care. In the consultation (n=102), most frequently reported health problems were pain, fatigue, photosensitivity, mood disorders, renal damage, poor concentration, and memory loss. Dissatisfaction with poor coordination between primary and specialized care was reported. Information to improve self-management and on alternative therapies was requested. Relevant topics from both sources were merged and discussed by the guideline development group (including a patient representative) to set the key questions underpinning the CPG. CONCLUSION: Patient involvement in CPG development by a combination of methods can enhance patient-centered care by achieving clinical practice responsive to their needs. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Involving patients in CPG development is feasible and useful to improve the advance of Health Services toward patient-centered care. A multicomponent strategy for involvement is suggested to address the gap between the available evidence and contextual current patient needs and preferences. Copyright ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Patient participation in the development of a clinical guideline for inherited retinal dystrophies.	"Objective: To identify the most relevant self-perceived health problems and unmet needs among adults with inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) in order to incorporate patients' perspective from the initial design of a clinical practice guideline (CPG) for IRDs in Spain. Research design and methods: A systematic review (SR) and a survey according to the Delphi method were carried out. Main Outcome Measures: Self-perceived health problems, unmet needs of care and treatment expectations related to IRDs. Results: From the SR, no information was found regarding unmet health care needs or dissatisfaction with health care services. In the survey, the most significant self-reported health problems were progressive decrease in visual acuity, visual field loss, abnormal sensitivity to light or glare, and night blindness. The main unmet needs were scarcity of disease information, lack of protocols for effective disease management and limited professional empathy. Treatment expectations were focused on the availability of protective and aids devices, easier access to rehabilitative services and psychological support. Conclusion: Patient involvement in CPG development helps to reduce the gap between the drawbacks of the routine clinical management and real-life needs of patients, especially in the context of rare diseases as IRDs where evidence-based therapies are scarce."
Patient Portals Facilitating Engagement With Inpatient Electronic Medical Records: A Systematic Review	"BACKGROUND: Engaging patients in the delivery of health care has the potential to improve health outcomes and patient satisfaction. Patient portals may enhance patient engagement by enabling patients to access their electronic medical records (EMRs) and facilitating secure patient-provider communication. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review literature describing patient portals tethered to an EMR in inpatient settings, their role in patient engagement, and their impact on health care delivery in order to identify factors and best practices for successful implementation of this technology and areas that require further research. METHODS: A systematic search for articles in the PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases was conducted using keywords associated with patient engagement, electronic health records, and patient portals and their respective subject headings in each database. Articles for inclusion were evaluated for quality using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) for systematic review articles and the Quality Assessment Tool for Studies with Diverse Designs for empirical studies. Included studies were categorized by their focus on input factors (eg, portal design), process factors (eg, portal use), and output factors (eg, benefits) and by the valence of their findings regarding patient portals (ie, positive, negative, or mixed). RESULTS: The systematic search identified 58 articles for inclusion. The inputs category was addressed by 40 articles, while the processes and outputs categories were addressed by 36 and 46 articles, respectively: 47 articles addressed multiple themes across the three categories, and 11 addressed only a single theme. Nineteen articles had high- to very high-quality, 21 had medium quality, and 18 had low- to very low-quality. Findings in the inputs category showed wide-ranging portal designs; patients' privacy concerns and lack of encouragement from providers were among portal adoption barriers while information access and patient-provider communication were among facilitators. Several methods were used to train portal users with varying success. In the processes category, sociodemographic characteristics and medical conditions of patients were predictors of portal use; some patients wanted unlimited access to their EMRs, personalized health education, and nonclinical information; and patients were keen to use portals for communicating with their health care teams. In the outputs category, some but not all studies found patient portals improved patient engagement; patients perceived some portal functions as inadequate but others as useful; patients and staff thought portals may improve patient care but could cause anxiety in some patients; and portals improved patient safety, adherence to medications, and patient-provider communication but had no impact on objective health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: While the evidence is currently immature, patient portals have demonstrated benefit by enabling the discovery of medical errors, improving adherence to medications, and providing patient-provider communication, etc. High-quality studies are needed to fully understand, improve, and evaluate their impact.

Patient-centred outcomes for prehospital trauma trials: A systematic review and patient involvement exercise.	"Introduction: Outcome measures are used in clinical trials to determine efficacy of interventions. We aimed to determine which outcome measures in prehospital major trauma trials have been reported in the literature, and which of these are most patient-centred."
Patient-professional partnerships and chronic back pain self-management: a qualitative systematic review and synthesis	"Chronic back pain is common, and its self-management may be a lifelong task for many patients. While health professionals can provide a service or support for pain, only patients can actually experience it. It is likely that optimum self-management of chronic back pain may only be achieved when patients and professionals develop effective partnerships which integrate their complementary knowledge and skills. However, at present, there is no evidence to explain how such partnerships can influence patients' self-management ability. This review aimed to explore the influence of patient-professional partnerships on patients' ability to self-manage chronic back pain, and to identify key factors within these partnerships that may influence self-management. A systematic review was undertaken, aiming to retrieve relevant studies using any research method. Five databases were searched for papers published between 1980 and 2014, including Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Medline, EMBASE and PsycINFO. Eligible studies were those reporting on patients being supported by professionals to self-manage chronic back pain; patients being actively involved for self-managing chronic back pain; and the influence of patient-professional partnerships on self-management of chronic back pain. Included studies were critically appraised for quality, and findings were extracted and analysed thematically. A total of 738 studies were screened, producing 10 studies for inclusion, all of which happened to use qualitative methods. Seven themes were identified: communication, mutual understanding, roles of health professionals, information delivery, patients' involvement, individualised care and healthcare service. These themes were developed into a model suggesting how factors within patient-professional partnerships influence self-management. Review findings suggest that a partnership between patients and professionals supports patients' self-management ability, and effective communication is a fundamental factor underpinning their partnerships in care. It also calls for the development of individualised healthcare services offering self-referral or telephone consultation to patients with chronic conditions. Copyright ¬© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Patient, Family, and Community Advisory Councils in Health Care and Research: a Systematic Review."	"BACKGROUND: Patient-centeredness is a characteristic of high-quality medical care and requires engaging community members in health systems' decision-making. One key patient engagement strategy is patient, family, and community advisory boards/councils (PFACs), yet the evidence to guide PFACs is lacking. Systematic reviews on patient engagement may benefit from patient input, but feasibility is unclear. METHODS: A team of physicians, researchers, and a PFAC member conducted a systematic review to examine the impact of PFACs on health systems and describe optimal strategies for PFAC conduct. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, and Social Science Citation Index from inception through September 2016, as well as pre-identified websites. Two reviewers independently screened and abstracted data from studies, then assessed randomized studies for risk of bias and observational studies for quality using standardized measures. We performed a realist synthesis-which asks what works, for whom, under what circumstances-of abstracted data via 12 monthly meetings between investigators and two feedback sessions with a hospital-based PFAC. RESULTS: Eighteen articles describing 16 studies met study criteria. Randomized studies demonstrated moderate to high risk of bias and observational studies demonstrated poor to fair quality. Studies engaged patients at multiple levels of the health care system and suggested that in-person deliberation with health system leadership was most effective. Studies involving patient engagement in research focused on increasing study participation. PFAC recruitment was by nomination (n = 11) or not described (n = 5). No common measure of patient, family, or community engagement was identified. Realist synthesis was enriched by feedback from PFAC members. DISCUSSION: PFACs engage communities through individual projects but evidence of their impact on outcomes is lacking. A paucity of randomized controlled trials or high-quality observational studies guide strategies for engagement through PFACs. Standardized measurement tools for engagement are needed. Strategies for PFAC recruitment should be investigated and reported. PFAC members can feasibly contribute to systematic reviews. REGISTRATION AND FUNDING SOURCE: A protocol for record eligibility was developed a priori and was registered in the PROSPERO database of systematic reviews (registration number CRD42016052817). The Department of Veterans Affairs' Office of Academic Affiliations, through the National Clinician Scholars Program, funded this study."
Patients' Perspectives and Experiences Living with Systemic Sclerosis: A Systematic Review and Thematic Synthesis of Qualitative Studies	"OBJECTIVE: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic, progressive autoimmune disease with major end-organ involvement. Much attention has been focused on the management of physical and clinical manifestations; however, the effect of the disease and treatment on the patient's identity, relationships, functioning, and mental well-being are less known. We aimed to describe the patients' perspectives and experiences of living with SSc. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to October 2014. Thematic synthesis was used to analyze the findings. RESULTS: We included 26 studies involving 463 patients. Six key themes were identified: distressing appearance transformation (disturbing facial changes, stigmatizing sickness, unrecognizable self), palpable physical limitations (bodily restrictions, frustrating mind-body disconnect, pervasive fatigue, disabling pain), social impairment (breaking intimacy, struggling to fulfill family responsibilities, maintaining work, losing independence), navigating uncertainty (diagnostic ambiguity, medically fending for oneself, unpredictable course of illness), alone and misunderstood (fearful avoidance of fellow patients, invisible suffering), and gradual acceptance and relative optimism (adapting to change and accepting limitations, taking a positive spin, cautious hoping, empowering relationships, valuing medical support). CONCLUSION: SSc is a rare and unpredictable illness that undermines patients' sense of certainty and control and impairs their self-image, identity, and daily functioning. Patient-centered care that encompasses strategies to promote self-esteem, resilience, and self-efficacy may help to improve treatment satisfaction and health and quality of life outcomes for patients with SSc."
Peer-reviewed articles on inclusive research: Do co-researchers with intellectual disabilities have a voice?	"Background Inclusive research is increasingly common in intellectual disabilities research, but ways in which voice of co-researchers with intellectual disabilities is presented remain underexplored in the literature. Materials and Method The authors conducted a literature review and analysis of peer-reviewed journal articles reporting on inclusive research. The aim was to explore the ways the voices of co-researchers with intellectual disabilities are represented in published peer-reviewed journal articles. Results The findings indicate that there are a wide range of ways in which inclusive research projects are reported in peer-reviewed journals. However, the experiences, views and opinions of co-researchers are often either absent or very selectively reported. Conclusions The article concludes that although inclusive research has proliferated in the 21st century, more attention needs to be paid to the ways in which the voices of co-researchers with intellectual disabilities are heard in formal academic contexts. Guidelines for future practice are offered."
Perceptions and experiences of labour companionship: a qualitative evidence synthesis.	"BACKGROUND: Labour companionship refers to support provided to a woman during labour and childbirth, and may be provided by a partner, family member, friend, doula or healthcare professional. A Cochrane systematic review of interventions by Bohren and colleagues, concluded that having a labour companion improves outcomes for women and babies. The presence of a labour companion is therefore regarded as an important aspect of improving quality of care during labour and childbirth; however implementation of the intervention is not universal. Implementation of labour companionship may be hampered by limited understanding of factors affecting successful implementation across contexts. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the review were to describe and explore the perceptions and experiences of women, partners, community members, healthcare providers and administrators, and other key stakeholders regarding labour companionship; to identify factors affecting successful implementation and sustainability of labour companionship; and to explore how the findings of this review can enhance understanding of the related Cochrane systematic review of interventions. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and POPLINE K4Health databases for eligible studies from inception to 9 September 2018. There were no language, date or geographic restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis; focused on women's, partners', family members', doulas', providers', or other relevant stakeholders' perceptions and experiences of labour companionship; and were from any type of health facility in any setting globally. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used a thematic analysis approach for data extraction and synthesis, and assessed the confidence in the findings using the GRADE-CERQual approach. We used two approaches to integrate qualitative findings with the intervention review findings. We used a logic model to theorise links between elements of the intervention and health and well-being outcomes. We also used a matrix model to compare features of labour companionship identified as important in the qualitative evidence synthesis with the interventions included in the intervention review. MAIN RESULTS: We found 51 studies (52 papers), mostly from high-income countries and mostly describing women's perspectives. We assessed our level of confidence in each finding using the GRADE-CERQual approach. We had high or moderate confidence in many of our findings. Where we only had low or very low confidence in a finding, we have indicated this.Labour companions supported women in four different ways. Companions gave informational support by providing information about childbirth, bridging communication gaps between health workers and women, and facilitating non-pharmacological pain relief. Companions were advocates, which means they spoke up in support of the woman. Companions provided practical support, including encouraging women to move around, providing massage, and holding her hand. Finally, companions gave emotional support, using praise and reassurance to help women feel in control and confident, and providing a continuous physical presence.Women who wanted a companion present during labour and childbirth needed this person to be compassionate and trustworthy. Companionship helped women to have a positive birth experience. Women without a companion could perceive this as a negative birth experience. Women had mixed perspectives about wanting to have a male partner present (low confidence). Generally, men who were labour companions felt that their presence made a positive impact on both themselves (low confidence) and on the relationship with their partner and baby (low confidence), although some felt anxious witnessing labour pain (low confidence). Some male partners felt that they were not well integrated into the care team or decision-making.Doulas often met with women before birth to build rapport and manage expectations. Women could develop close bonds with their doulas (low confidence). Foreign-born women in high-income settings may appreciate support from community-based doulas to receive culturally-competent care (low confidence).Factors affecting implementation included health workers and women not recognising the benefits of companionship, lack of space and privacy, and fearing increased risk of infection (low confidence). Changing policies to allow companionship and addressing gaps between policy and practice were thought to be important (low confidence). Some providers were resistant to or not well trained on how to use companions, and this could lead to conflict. Lay companions were often not integrated into antenatal care, which may cause frustration (low confidence).We compared our findings from this synthesis to the companionship programmes/approaches assessed in Bohren's review of effectiveness. We found that most of these programmes did not appear to address these key features of labour companionship. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We have high or moderate confidence in the evidence contributing to several of these review findings. Further research, especially in low- and middle-income settings and with different cadres of healthcare providers, could strengthen the evidence for low- or very low-confidence findings. Ahead of implementation of labour companionship, researchers and programmers should consider factors that may affect implementation, including training content and timing for providers, women and companions; physical structure of the labour ward; specifying clear roles for companions and providers; integration of companions; and measuring the impact of companionship on women's experiences of care. Implementation research or studies conducted on labour companionship should include a qualitative component to evaluate the process and context of implementation, in order to better interpret results and share findings across contexts."
Physical Activity and Exercise Interventions in the Workplace Impacting Work Outcomes: A Stakeholder-Centered Best Evidence Synthesis of Systematic Reviews	"BACKGROUND: The prevention of work disability is beneficial to employees and employers, and mitigates unnecessary societal costs associated with social welfare. Many service providers and employers have initiated workplace interventions designed to reduce unnecessary work disability. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a best-evidence synthesis of systematic reviews on workplace interventions that address physical activities or exercise and their impact on workplace absence, work productivity or financial outcomes. METHODS: Using a participatory research approach, academics and stakeholders identified inclusion and exclusion criteria, built an abstraction table, evaluated systematic review quality and relevance, and interpreted the combined findings. A minimum of two scientists participated in a methodological review of the literature followed by a consensus process. RESULTS: Stakeholders and researchers participated as a collaborative team. 3363 unique records were identified, 115 full text articles and 46 systematic reviews were included, 18 assessed the impact of physical fitness or exercise interventions. 11 focused on general workers rather than workers who were absent from work at baseline; 16 of the reviews assessed work absence, 4 assessed productivity and 6 assessed financial impacts. CONCLUSION: The strongest evidence supports the use of short, simple exercise or fitness programs for both workers at work and those absent from work at baseline. For workers at work, simple exercise programs (1-2 modal components) appear to provide similar benefits to those using more complex multimodal interventions. For workers off-work with subacute low back pain, there is evidence that some complex exercise programs may be more effective than simple exercise interventions, especially if they involve workplace stakeholder engagement, communication and coordination with employers and other stakeholders. The development and utilization of standardized definitions, methods and measures and blinded evaluation would improve research quality and strengthen stakeholder-centered guidance."
Understanding patient engagement in health system decision-making: a co-designed scoping review.	"BACKGROUND: With healthcare striving to shift to a more person-centered delivery model, patient and family involvement must have a bigger role in shaping this. While many initiatives involving patients and family members focus on self-care, a broader understanding of patient participation is necessary. Ensuring a viable and sustainable critical number of qualified patients and family members to support this shift will be of utmost importance. The purpose of this study was to understand how health systems are intentionally investing in the training and skill development of patients and family members. METHODS: Patient co-investigators and researchers conducted a scoping review of the existing literature on methods adopted by healthcare systems to build the skills and capacity of patients to participate in healthcare decision-making using a recognized methodological framework. Six electronic databases were searched to identify studies. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts and full-text papers for inclusion. The research team independently extracted data. Any disagreements were resolved by achieving consensus through discussion. Quantitative and qualitative content synthesis, as well as a quality assessment, was conducted. RESULTS: After eliminating duplicates, the search resulted in 9428 abstracts. Four hundred fifty-eight articles were reviewed and 15 articles were included. Four themes emerged: forums (33%), patient instructors (20%), workshops (33%), and co-design (13%). Four of the identified studies measured the impact and overall effectiveness of the respective programs. Examples of how patient and family members were supported (invested in) included advocacy training to support future involvement in engagement activities, a training program to conduct patient-led research, involvement in an immersive experience-based co-design initiative, and involvement in training pharmacy students. Overall, these studies found positive outcomes when patients and family members were recipients of these opportunities. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this scoping review demonstrate that an evidence base around programs to advance patient engagement is largely absent. An opportunity exists for further research to identify strategies and measures to support patient engagement in healthcare decision-making."
